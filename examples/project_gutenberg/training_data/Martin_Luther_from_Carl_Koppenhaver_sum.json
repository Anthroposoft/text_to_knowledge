    "summary": "In the chapter \"THE MINER'S SON\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" we are introduced to the tumultuous and fear-ridden world into which Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. The era was marked by the advance of the Turks into Europe, a distant and vengeful perception of God, and widespread superstition, including fears of witches and demons. Despite these challenges, Luther emerged as a figure of resilience, deeply convinced of God's love and mercy, and possessed of a common sense that would later make him a pivotal figure in Christian history.\n\nThe narrative begins with Luther's humble origins, born to Hans and Margarethe Luther, industrious but simple folk who had recently moved in hopes of prosperity through the copper mines. Luther's early life was characterized by hardship, but also by his parents' determination to provide him with an education, which saw him moving from singing and begging for his keep to being taken in by Frau Ursula Cotta, a cultured woman who recognized his potential.\n\nLuther's academic journey was marked by diligence and success, leading him to the University of Erfurt, where he achieved both his bachelor's and master's degrees. Despite his father's wishes for him to pursue a career in law, Luther experienced a profound religious calling that led him to abandon his studies and enter an Augustinian monastery in 1505. This decision, spurred by a series of life-threatening events and a deep-seated fear of sin and damnation, marked a pivotal turn in Luther's life.\n\nHis time in the monastery was characterized by rigorous ascetic practices, but also by a growing dissatisfaction with the scholastic theology of the time, which emphasized personal effort in achieving divine favor. Despite his efforts, Luther found no peace of conscience, leading him to continue his theological studies with the hope of finding answers.\n\nLuther's priestly duties and his appointment to the chair of moral philosophy at the University of Wittenberg allowed him to delve deeper into theology, eventually leading to a mission to Rome. This journey, while initially undertaken with reverence, ultimately left Luther disillusioned with the opulence and scandal he observed at the papal court, though his faith in the church itself remained intact.\n\nThrough the detailed recounting of Luther's early life, \"THE MINER'S SON\" chapter not only provides insight into the formative experiences that shaped one of Christianity's most influential figures but also paints a vivid picture of the socio-religious context of late medieval Europe. Koppenhaver's narrative captures the essence of Luther's journey from a miner's son to a devout monk and scholar, setting the stage for his eventual role in the Reformation.",
    "original_text": "The Turk was slashing his way up the valley of the Danube into the heart of Europe. God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest lurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.\nInto such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by superstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm, convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a Christian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth was lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the impact of his life.\nThe Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning after his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They had moved recently from the farming community of Möhra, home of the Luther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the copper mines.\nWhen Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by Mansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time Martin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was the custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door with one of the school choirs.\nHe stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish school of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by singing and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a woman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar into her home.\nHans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was seventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of Erfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had passed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.\nObedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began his post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field of law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the whole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian monastery.\nHans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were astounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in the words \"religious experience.\"\nHis parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early influence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and the last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle ages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school. His introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and shortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness and heaven.\n\nSeveral grim incidents increased his anxiety. While on a holiday from the university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his student sword. He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague moved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to Mansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning struck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\" Fifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of the \"Black Cloister,\" monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in Erfurt.\nThat this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and that his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of a monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university, later proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.\nLuther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain for several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being examined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was shaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl, and formally received as a novice.\nHe scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various ascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended Luther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was received into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and scholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for the priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.\nThe petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's energy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic theology available at that time. However, long hours with books did little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.\n\nAlthough his heart was not at rest, Luther continued to perform his priestly duties and undertake any new tasks assigned to him. In the fall of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been entrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established University of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of the Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called back to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for about a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another monk on a mission to Rome.\nIn the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible. His high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of its reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church remained unshaken.",

Koppenhaver's work \"Martin Luther,\" Luther, troubled by spiritual turmoil, is advised by Staupitz to pursue a doctor's degree and take on the role of a Bible professor at Wittenberg University. This advice proves beneficial as Luther delves deeper into the Bible, moving beyond secondary writings. By October 18-19, 1512, Luther becomes Martin Luther, a doctor of sacred scripture and a professor of Bible at the university. He had been serving as subprior and regent at the Black Cloister in Wittenberg since May 1512, later becoming a district vicar for Thuringia and Meissen in May 1515. Through his daily tasks and studies, Luther gradually realizes that righteousness cannot be earned through works, contrary to the medieval belief he had held. This realization leads to the development of his doctrine of \"justification by faith,\" understanding that it is God's grace, not human effort, that makes man righteous and enables salvation.",

But who, he asked himself, is righteous?\nAs he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries, he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that grace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New Testament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this came the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"",

    "summary": "In the chapter titled \"THE PROFESSOR\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" the narrative delves into a significant period of Luther's life, marking his transition from an earnest young priest grappling with profound theological doubts to a revolutionary figure challenging the core tenets of the medieval church. Upon his return from Rome, Luther is appointed as a professor at Wittenberg in the summer of 1511, where he falls under the mentorship of John von Staupitz, the vicar of the Augustinian order. Staupitz plays a crucial role in Luther's spiritual journey, offering him warmth, understanding, and guidance through his crises of faith.\n\nLuther's early theological struggles are characterized by an intense pursuit of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness, which he initially seeks through good works and confession. However, he finds these methods inadequate for attaining salvation, leading to a series of spiritual crises. Staupitz's theology, emphasizing complete surrender to God's grace rather than self-assertion through works, contrasts sharply with Luther's efforts. Despite attempting to embrace Staupitz's mystical approach, Luther cannot reconcile it with his own view of God as a judgmental figure.\n\nTo alleviate Luther's distress, Staupitz advises him to pursue a doctorate in sacred scripture and assume the chair of Bible at Wittenberg University. This shift towards academic and pastoral responsibilities, including becoming subprior and district vicar overseeing multiple monasteries, inadvertently sets the stage for Luther's theological breakthrough. Through his engagement with the Bible and his duties, Luther comes to reject the medieval notion that grace is earned, embracing instead the doctrine of \"justification by faith\" – the belief that salvation is a free gift from God, not a reward for human righteousness.\n\nLuther's newfound understanding marks a departure from the teachings of the Roman Church, though he initially believes he is merely rediscovering established truths. Deeper study convinces him of the stark contrast between his beliefs and medieval theology, particularly the idea that salvation is solely the work of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This realization leads Luther to reject the authority of medieval writers and church teachings that contradict the Bible, setting him on a path of open revolt against the church, beginning with his opposition to the sale of indulgencies.\n\nThe chapter encapsulates Luther's transformation from a troubled monk into a pioneering theologian, whose personal quest for understanding God's grace lays the foundation for challenging the church's prevailing doctrines and practices, ultimately leading to the Protestant Reformation. Through Koppenhaver's narrative, we witness the intricate interplay of mentorship, personal struggle, and scholarly pursuit that culminates in Luther's radical theological insights, reshaping the Christian faith and the church's role in salvation.",
    "original_text": "Luther returned to Erfurt from Rome, and in the summer of 1511 was sent as one of three new professors to Wittenberg. Here he came under the influence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who showed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.\nAs yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but he never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried the path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than could be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.\nLuther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined stages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series of crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave periods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through his own works.\nStaupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's weakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was no striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual found peace in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts were virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with self-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.\n\nLuther's troubled spirit did not lower him in the vicar's estimation and, perhaps to get his mind off it, Staupitz advised him to study for a doctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university.

    "summary": "John Tetzel, a Dominican prior known for selling indulgences, conducted a campaign where Luther's parishioners bought indulgences despite Frederick the Wise having his own indulgence collection. Luther, realizing the danger of this practice, posted ninety-five theses on the Castle Church's door, inviting debate on indulgences. He argued for repentance as a lifelong process, critiqued indulgences as mere remissions of church-imposed penalties, and believed he was defending the Roman Church by addressing these issues. Luther's theses gained widespread support, becoming a focal point for those opposing Rome's financial exploitation and foreign dominance. Despite initial displeasure, Luther's actions sparked a significant movement against indulgences and papal interference, with Elector Frederick supporting him against charges of heresy.",
    "original_text": "John Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel. Luther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him indulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard on the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to Rome.\nThe theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration of revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to theologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence situation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.\nThe points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but merely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther maintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong experience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome sinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties which the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the departed and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.\nLuther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by attempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he thought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the theses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were applauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.\nThere had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own national affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for those who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but also for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power. Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector Frederick stood by his daring young monk.\nAs the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the cause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to enable him to publish some theses of his own.\nWhen the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students at Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire. Luther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased by their sophomoric act.\nLuther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded them to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a row between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther with heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther received notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.\nBy no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy.

    "summary": "The chapter \"Collision with Rome\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into the profound theological and institutional conflicts between Martin Luther and the Roman Catholic Church, primarily focusing on the contentious issue of indulgences. The Roman Church's doctrine that forgiveness of sins was attainable through the sacrament of penance, involving contrition, confession, and satisfaction through good works, is outlined. This framework posited that those failing to perform sufficient penance in life would endure purgatory's torments until their sins were atoned for. The practice of purchasing indulgences emerged as a means to mitigate this purgatorial punishment, a concept Luther found fundamentally flawed, arguing that grace is a divine gift, not a commodity to be earned or bought.\n\nThe narrative unfolds with the sale of indulgences in the archbishopric of Mainz by Albert of Brandenburg, who had acquired the position through substantial financial transactions with Pope Leo X, aimed at funding the construction of St. Peter's Church in Rome. John Tetzel, a Dominican known for his effective indulgence salesmanship, led this campaign, avoiding Luther's parish due to the local indulgence traffic managed by Frederick the Wise. However, Luther's confrontation with the practice began when his parishioners purchased indulgences from Tetzel, challenging Luther's teachings on repentance with the supposed sin-remitting powers of indulgences.\n\nLuther's response was the posting of his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Castle Church on October 31, an act not of rebellion but an academic invitation to debate the indulgence issue. His theses criticized the indulgence system, emphasizing that repentance should be a continuous endeavor and that indulgences could not remit sins, a power belonging solely to God. This action, intended as a loyal attempt to reform the Church from within, unexpectedly garnered widespread public support and marked a rallying point for German resentment against the papacy's financial exploitation and political dominance.\n\nThe dispute escalated as the Dominicans, supporting Tetzel, opposed the Augustinians rallying around Luther. The situation intensified when Luther's theses reached Rome, leading to accusations of heresy and a summons for Luther to stand trial. Elector Frederick's intervention ensured that the trial would occur on German soil, reflecting the growing resistance to papal authority. Cardinal Cajetan's failed attempt to persuade Luther to recant in Augsburg, followed by the Elector's refusal to extradite Luther without a fair trial, highlighted the deepening rift.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, attempting to mediate the conflict through diplomacy, acknowledging Luther's significant popular support. Luther agreed to have his case reviewed by a German bishop, provided his opponents also ceased their attacks, setting the stage for further developments in Luther's reformative efforts.\n\nThis chapter meticulously captures the initial stages of Luther's clash with the Roman Catholic Church, underscoring the theological disputes, institutional corruption, and the broader political and social dynamics at play. It portrays Luther not as a rebel intent on division but as a reformer seeking to correct the Church's deviations from Christian doctrine.",
    "original_text": "The Roman Church taught that forgiveness of sins could be secured only through the sacrament of penance. This required contrition of heart, confession to a priest, and satisfaction by good works. Release from the penalty of eternal punishment was guaranteed by the absolution pronounced by the priest. If not enough works of penance were done before death, however, the remainder had to be atoned for in the torments of purgatory for an indefinite period.\nGradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences to offset purgatorial punishment. It was at this point that Luther's theology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift, but indulgences implied that man can earn grace.\nIn 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric of Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg. Because of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable investment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to be a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before negotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.\nAlbert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg. Then the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that he could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise additional sums for St. Peter's.\n\nJohn Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg.

Andrew Carlstadt, a supporter of Luther from Wittenberg, had been publicly advocating for Luther and engaging in a pamphlet debate with Eck. A public debate between Carlstadt and Eck was organized in Leipzig, where Eck strategically formulated twelve theses targeting Luther's theology rather than Carlstadt's views, indicating a deliberate attempt to provoke Luther into a theological confrontation.",
    "original_text": "Even while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up which drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to recant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with Rome.\nAndrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of Luther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck through the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was arranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve theses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with the theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was baiting Luther into the arena.",

The debate focused on topics like grace, free will, and the divine right of the pope. Eck initially outshone Carlstadt in erudition, but anticipation grew for Luther's participation. Luther and Eck debated the pope's divine right, with Luther asserting Christ as the church's head. Eck resorted to discrediting Luther by associating him with heresy, particularly with John Hus, leading Luther to emphasize the fallibility of councils and his reliance on the Scriptures.",

Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take the field.\nFor another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been established by Christ.\nLuther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's previous statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said, is the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.\nThe crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps if he made him synonymous with heresy....\nCraftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.\nIt was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers. The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were genuinely Christian and evangelical.\nThe spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault. This was heresy.\nLuther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make him infallible. After all, he was human.\nNow this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\nResults of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther, questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.\nLuther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church effected.\nThe controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\nGradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts, sermons, and commentaries.",

Luther vehemently denied the accusation and defended Hus's Christian and evangelical beliefs. The debate culminated in Luther's realization that even general councils could err, leading him to prioritize the infallible Word of God over human authorities.

    "summary": "The chapter \"THE BREACH WIDENS\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a pivotal period in Luther's life, marked by escalating confrontations with the Roman Catholic Church's established doctrines and the Leipzig debate, which significantly propelled the Reformation movement.\n\nThe narrative begins with Luther's encounter with John Eck, an ambitious professor from the University of Ingolstadt, known for his debating prowess and desire to gain favor with Rome. Eck saw an opportunity in Luther's willingness to recant if proven wrong and initiated a public debate with Andrew Carlstadt of Wittenberg, eventually baiting Luther into a direct confrontation. This debate, held in Leipzig in 1519, was not just a theological dispute but a spectacle drawing attention from students and scholars alike, highlighting the deep divisions within the Christian community.\n\nDuring the debate, Eck and Luther sparred over the divine right of the pope and the interpretation of biblical texts, particularly the passage in St. Matthew concerning the \"rock\" upon which Christ would build his church. Luther's assertion that the church was built on the faith in Christ, rather than the papal authority of Peter, marked a significant departure from orthodox views.\n\nThe turning point in the debate, and arguably for Luther's role in the Reformation, came when Eck attempted to discredit Luther by associating his views with those of the condemned Bohemian reformer, John Hus. Luther's defense of Hus's views as \"genuinely Christian and evangelical\" and his bold claim that even general councils could err, underscored a radical shift towards scriptural authority over ecclesiastical authority. This stance led to Luther's views being condemned as heretical by the University of Paris, further alienating him from the Catholic Church.\n\nDespite the official condemnation, the Leipzig debate crystallized Luther's reformative views, including the limitations of papal and council authority, the supremacy of the Bible, and the concept of the Church as a community of believers beyond the Roman institution. These ideas laid the groundwork for the Reformation, challenging the very foundations of the Catholic Church.\n\nParallel to these theological developments, the chapter also touches on the political landscape of the time, particularly the election of Charles of Spain as the Holy Roman Emperor. Luther's growing prominence and the disillusionment with Charles's lack of national allegiance to Germany contributed to Luther being seen as a potential leader for not only religious but also political, intellectual, and economic freedom. This broad support base among scholars, princes, knights, and commoners underscored Luther's evolving role as a leader of the Reformation, a movement that sought to fundamentally transform the Christian faith and European society.\n\nIn summary, \"THE BREACH WIDENS\" captures a critical juncture in Martin Luther's life and the broader Christian world, where theological debates sparked a movement challenging centuries-old doctrines and practices. Through the Leipzig debate and the shifting political allegiances of the time, Luther emerged as a pivotal figure in what would become known as the Reformation, setting the stage for profound religious and societal changes.",
    "original_text": "Even while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up which drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to recant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with Rome.\nAndrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of Luther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck through the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was arranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve theses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with the theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was baiting Luther into the arena.\n\nAfter months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and with much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519. Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take the field.\nFor another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been established by Christ.\nLuther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's previous statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said, is the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.\nThe crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps if he made him synonymous with heresy....\nCraftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.\nIt was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers. The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were genuinely Christian and evangelical.\nThe spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault. This was heresy.\nLuther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make him infallible. After all, he was human.\nNow this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\nResults of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther, questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.\nLuther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church effected.\nThe controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\nGradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts, sermons, and commentaries.\n\nIn addition to the Leipzig debate, the summer of 1519 brought forth another event which was significant in Luther's life. Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was of utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently, there was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a Hapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a strong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an outlying province of Spain.\nWide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes of many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role of national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars, princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called it the Reformation.",

In justifying man, God has freed him from the consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.\nThis freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates, passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to none.\"\nThe second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no less than become the servant of all.\nThe treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.\nA chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized. Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian liberty.\nOn the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to prove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies, he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather than individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this instance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where individual freedom before God was essential.\nThe papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the burning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and warned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication. Distribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome Aleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books in several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to strenuous opposition by the German people.",

    "summary": "In the chapter \"Luther Explains Himself\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" the narrative delves into Martin Luther's escalating confrontation with the Roman Catholic Church, highlighting his efforts to reform its practices and doctrines. Luther's journey begins with his attempts to engage the Pope and the church's hierarchy in a dialogue about reform, which ultimately proved fruitless. This failure prompts him to reach out directly to the secular rulers of the German nation through his seminal work, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,\" published in August 1520. In this treatise, Luther challenges the clergy's corruption and calls upon the laity, especially the nobility, to take responsibility for the church's moral and spiritual integrity, leveraging their Christian duty to oppose vice and wickedness.\n\nLuther criticizes the church's defensive mechanisms, which he identifies as three \"walls\" that have prevented reform: the church's claim to be beyond secular jurisdiction, the exclusive right of the Pope to interpret Scriptures, and the assertion that only the Pope can convene a council. He methodically dismantles these walls by asserting the priesthood of all believers, advocating for the individual's right to interpret Scriptures, and emphasizing the collective responsibility of Christians in church governance.\n\nFollowing this, Luther writes \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\" targeting theologians and aiming to liberate Christian practices from the Roman sacramental system. He disputes the church's monopoly over dispensing grace through the sacraments, performed exclusively by ordained priests, and argues for a reduction of the sacraments to only two—baptism and the Lord's Supper—based on their institution by Christ and their promise of forgiveness.\n\nLuther's redefinition of the mass into the Lord's Supper underscores a shift from a sacrificial act performed by a priest to a communal act of faith, emphasizing the direct communion between the believer and Christ without the need for a mediating priesthood. This theological stance not only challenges the church's control over grace but also its financial exploitation through the sale of indulgences.\n\nAttempting to reconcile with Pope Leo X, Luther writes a letter assuring the Pope that his criticisms are not personal but directed at the corrupt system. Alongside this letter, he sends his \"Treatise on Christian Liberty,\" which contrasts theological conflicts with a message of Christian freedom and service. Despite these efforts, Pope Leo had already excommunicated Luther, a fact Luther responds to by publicly burning the papal bull, an act symbolizing his break with the church and marking him as an outlaw by Rome.\n\nThe chapter meticulously outlines Luther's theological arguments, his strategic appeals to different audiences, and the dramatic actions that culminated in his excommunication and outlaw status. Through these developments, Luther emerges not just as a theologian but as a revolutionary figure challenging the ecclesiastical and social order of his time, advocating for a Christianity rooted in individual faith and direct relationship with God, free from the mediating and often corrupting influence of the institutional church.",
    "original_text": "Luther's attempts to interest the pope in reform had proved futile. He was likewise unsuccessful in having a general council convened to consider his propositions. Now, in the first of three great treatises, he called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state of the church.\nAppearing in August, 1520, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and prodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians are priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct of the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice and wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or in the monastery.\nNo one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists because they have erected three walls of defense, \"_First_, when pressed by the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope. _Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that no one can call a council but the pope.\"\nLuther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal before God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also a cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of \"priest\" is conferred by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the holder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.\nHe breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him in the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management in the church.\nBefore his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his second treatise, \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.\" The first had been primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It aimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the \"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system.\nThe Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace associated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be performed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church controlled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its most vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer bind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest artillery.\nHe reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants of a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free gift to the individual believer.\nIn the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as taught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted by Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make use of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.\n\nThe mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and crucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice man tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of the believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine should be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the wine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover, Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His sacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's sins are remitted if he has faith.\nMiltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther and the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write a letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his attacks on the papacy.\nIn the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his advisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who make him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, \"for through them Satan already has made much headway.\" He also assured Leo that he was an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing against him personally.\nAccompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, \"A Treatise on Christian Liberty.\" It expresses calm Christian reflection quite different from the theological conflicts which were carried forward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions which seem to be a paradox: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none,\" and \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\"\nThe first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been liberated and restored to a right relationship with God through justifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.\nThis freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates, passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to none.\"\nThe second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no less than become the servant of all.\nThe treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.\nA chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized. Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian liberty.\nOn the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to prove he was being consistent.

    "summary": "The summary effectively encapsulates the legal and political circumstances preceding Martin Luther's appearance at the imperial assembly at Worms. It outlines the positions of key figures like Charles, Frederick the Wise, and Aleander, elucidating the complexities leading to Luther's safe-conduct to Worms.",
    "original_text": "Charles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial constitution which said no German should be taken outside his country for trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing. Frederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using these same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative, wanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well aware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man had been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the rulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further examination of his views.\nFor the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to transacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed his mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing. Finally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct to Worms.\nIn a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from Wittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him to preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms. When the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on April 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the city gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther was barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St. John.\nHe was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and because of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and alleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door of the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On it sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table loaded with books.\nAfter the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer, an official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked Luther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had written.\nLuther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions and was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could not be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that the titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.\nAgain the question, \"Will you retract...?\"\nThe monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's Word. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\" Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.\nAfter a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but this time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or are you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it. They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was impossible.\nThe books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against individuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and intemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the fires.\nObviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther. \"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not recant your errors?\"\nThe Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.\n\"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will answer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.\nThe spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to all corners of the room.\n\"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against conscience. God help me! Amen.\"\nThere was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.\nCharles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.\nHaving received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.",

    "summary": "The chapter \"THE MONK STANDS FIRM\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a pivotal moment in the Protestant Reformation, capturing the tension and drama surrounding Martin Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms in 1521. The narrative begins with the backdrop of political and religious intrigue, highlighting the pressures from the Roman Church for the secular authorities, particularly Emperor Charles V and Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, to take decisive action against Luther following his excommunication. Despite the church's condemnation, Luther's journey to Worms is marked by widespread public support, underscoring his growing influence and the contentious atmosphere of the time.\n\nUpon his arrival in Worms, Luther is met with an overwhelming reception, indicating the significant public interest in his case. The detailed account of his appearance before the Diet, under the watchful eyes of Emperor Charles V, the nobility, and ecclesiastical authorities, sets the stage for a dramatic confrontation. Luther is asked to recant his writings, which he categorizes into three groups: devotional works, criticisms of the papacy, and personal attacks. He admits to harsh language in the latter but stands firm on the content of his works, refusing to recant unless convinced by Scripture or sound reason.\n\nLuther's bold stance, encapsulated in his famous declaration that he cannot act against his conscience, marks a defining moment in the Reformation. The immediate aftermath of his refusal sees a mix of chaos and admiration, with Luther gaining further support among the nobles and the public. However, the political complexities of the situation are evident in Emperor Charles V's deliberations with the electors and princes on how to proceed, balancing the desire to condemn Luther with the need for German support in other matters.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the issuance of the Edict of Worms, declaring Luther an outlaw and demanding his capture. This edict represents the culmination of the Diet's proceedings and sets the stage for the next phase of Luther's struggle and the broader Reformation movement. Through this detailed account, Koppenhaver captures the intricate interplay of religion, politics, and personal conviction that defined Luther's stand at Worms, a stand that would have lasting implications for Christianity and European history.",

In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\" Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.\nAfter a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but this time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or are you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it. They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was impossible.\nThe books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against individuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and intemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the fires.\nObviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther. \"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not recant your errors?\"\nThe Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.\n\"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will answer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.\nThe spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to all corners of the room.\n\"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against conscience. God help me! Amen.\"\nThere was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.\nCharles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.\nHaving received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.",

    "original_text": "She and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan of escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him personally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in empty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes, husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking. Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which he had urged on so many others.\nIt was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\nMarriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years. Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.\nThe vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be imagined by his reference to her as \"my lord Kathie.\" She was an efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.\nThings improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home, and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the university.",

    "summary": "The chapter \"Drastic Changes\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a transformative period in Luther's life, marked by significant personal and societal shifts. Initially, Luther finds himself in a precarious situation, necessitating a strategic \"kidnapping\" to the Wartburg castle for safety after his safe-conduct expires. This period of forced seclusion prompts deep self-reflection and prolific writing, including the translation of the New Testament into German, signaling his unwavering commitment to reforming the church and making religious texts accessible to the common people.\n\nLuther's time at Wartburg is a crucible for his theological convictions. Despite grappling with doubt, his resolve is fortified through prayer and study, leading him to re-enter the world with a renewed sense of purpose. His return to Wittenberg is prompted by reports of radical reforms and unrest, which he perceives as deviating from the true essence of the Reformation. Luther advocates for a measured approach to reform, emphasizing internal faith over external practices, a stance that restores some order amidst the chaos.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the broader societal impact of Luther's teachings, particularly their unintended role in fueling the Peasants' War. Luther's emphasis on spiritual freedom is co-opted by the peasantry as a rallying cry for social and economic reform, leading to a violent uprising that is ultimately quashed. This dark chapter underscores the complex interplay between religious reform and social change, highlighting Luther's conservative stance on obedience to secular authority.\n\nAmidst these tumultuous events, Luther's personal life undergoes a significant transformation through his marriage to Katherine von Bora, a former nun. This union, born from a shared desire for a life beyond the monastic vows and a mutual respect for each other's convictions, marks a departure from traditional clerical celibacy and underscores Luther's belief in the sanctity and value of marriage. The couple's life together in the Black Cloister becomes a beacon of domestic and communal harmony, offering a glimpse into Luther's ideals about family, education, and community living.\n\nIn summary, the chapter \"Drastic Changes\" captures a pivotal period in Martin Luther's life and the Reformation at large. It explores Luther's internal struggles, his strategic responses to external challenges, and the profound impact of his teachings on both the church and society. Through his writings, actions, and personal life choices, Luther emerges as a figure of both revolutionary and conservative impulses, advocating for a faith-driven reform of the church while upholding the value of social order and family life.",
    "original_text": "Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a \"kidnapping\" and removal to a safe place was planned.\nLuther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit relatives at Möhra. For months the outside world knew only that he had been captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights. Many lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to his adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed their fears.\nBy a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an ancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the exception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did not leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George, a carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side. The secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who authorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.\nLuther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to contemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel? Could a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error and drag many others to eternal damnation?\nHard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the Magnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well underway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.\nPrayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain silent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With conviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him back into the world again he went courageously and with determination. He was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what took him back to Wittenberg.\nSo often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was no exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from bondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly procedure.\nIn parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs, paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in the traditional forms were attacked.\nRumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise of Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December, 1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which they later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a \"warning against riot and rebellion,\" written on his return to the Wartburg.\nIn it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of faith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart of a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in God--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works. Giving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as the spiritual attitude of the communicant.\nFinally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522. Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.\nThe peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of bloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they adapted Luther's \"free lord of all\" statement to their own demands for social reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to lawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally defeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.\nWittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian nunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the local university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the Black Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were Artist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle Church; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....\nIf there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been announced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to appear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and slanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The malicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with a special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister, and a dance at the town hall on June 27.\nThe wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace. Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but marriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at the age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.\n\nShe and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan of escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him personally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in empty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes, husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking. Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which he had urged on so many others.\nIt was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\nMarriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years. Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.\nThe vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be imagined by his reference to her as \"my lord Kathie.\" She was an efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.\nThings improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home, and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the university.\n\nThe Luthers had six children.

It highlights Luther's concerns about the potential bureaucratization of the new church and emphasizes the necessity of proper instruction for all age groups.

Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony beginning in 1527.

    "summary": "The paragraph from the book \"Martin Luther\" by Carl E. Koppenhaver discusses the evolving perception of the church as distinct from the Roman hierarchy in cities like Wittenberg, highlighting the need for reorganization. It emphasizes the importance of a consistent supply of ministers, their training, and support. The text underscores the necessity of establishing a bond for unity and the urgency of mission work in areas where faith had waned. Despite Luther's reservations about organizational tasks, he recognized the critical need for proper instruction for all ages and the oversight required for this. Due to the neglect of laymen's instruction by bishops and reluctance from princes to reinstitute it, Luther advocated for congregations and city councils to take charge of selecting pastors, creating pastoral districts, and establishing schools. The text also mentions the formation of visitation committees, comprising knowledgeable individuals, to advise and support this restructuring effort, which began in Saxony in 1527 and expanded to other parts of Germany, laying the foundation for future organizational developments in the church.",

    "summary": "The chapter \"A Church Reborn\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into the transformative period of the Protestant Reformation, spearheaded by Martin Luther, and its profound impact on the Christian church and European society. As the Reformation gained momentum, the necessity for a reorganized church, distinct from the Roman hierarchy, became apparent. This reorganization involved establishing a reliable system for training and supporting ministers, creating a unified effort among congregations, and initiating mission work to rekindle faith in regions of indifference.\n\nLuther, who was not inclined towards organizational tasks, was concerned about the church becoming entangled in laws and regulations. Despite this, he recognized the urgent need for proper religious instruction for all ages, which led to the involvement of congregations and city councils in selecting pastors and establishing schools, under the guidance of visitation committees from 1527.\n\nThe political landscape of Germany at the time was divided between princes supporting the Roman Catholic cause and those favoring the Reformation. This division led to a series of diets and assemblies between 1525 and 1529, culminating in the Protest at Speyer in 1529, where Reformation princes opposed a resolution that sought to limit the spread of Luther's teachings, arguing that matters of salvation were personal and could not be legislated.\n\nThe Reformation's influence spread across Europe, leading to the emergence of various denominations. The Diet of Augsburg in 1530 was a significant attempt to reconcile these groups with Rome. Luther, unable to attend due to an imperial ban, contributed to the drafting of the Lutheran Confession, which articulated the fundamental doctrines of the Reformation. However, the emperor rejected this confession, leading to further estrangement between the Lutherans and the Roman Church.\n\nDespite initial setbacks, the Lutherans' resolve led to the formation of the League of Schmalkalden in 1531, a defensive alliance against Roman coercion. This period of relative peace was interrupted by the Turkish invasion and later by armed conflict over religious principles, which Luther did not live to see, passing away in 1546.\n\nThroughout his life, Luther was driven by a deep concern for understanding God's nature and sharing this understanding with others. His efforts to reform the church were rooted in a desire to align it more closely with the teachings of the Bible, emphasizing that God's love is a free gift, accessible to all without mediation. Luther's translation of the Bible into the vernacular and his advocacy for education and personal engagement with scripture were pivotal in democratizing religious knowledge and fostering a personal relationship with God among believers.\n\nIn summary, \"A Church Reborn\" captures the essence of Luther's role in the Reformation, highlighting his theological contributions, the political and social upheavals of the period, and his enduring legacy in shaping the Protestant faith and influencing the broader Christian tradition.",
    "original_text": "The people at Wittenberg and in other cities of influence were gradually learning to think of the church as separate from the Roman hierarchy. Now there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was essential and arrangements had to be made for their training and support. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of endeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had lapsed into indifference.\nLuther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted him. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use he felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there had to be some sort of oversight.\nThe bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were loath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony beginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of Germany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization began.\n\nIn the meantime two distinct factions had developed among the princes of Germany. One espoused the Roman cause, the other the Reformation. From 1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts which had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the Reformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to oppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared only eight years before were becoming the national mind.\nSparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with Rome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or confession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were actually submitted.\nAs usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced the emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best ammunition for the Saxon \"heretics,\" fully confident that a Lutheran defeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.\nStill under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at a castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others appearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight articles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The first twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures regarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church, the Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin, Good Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of Roman abuses which contradict the Word of God.\nThe emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation. On the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church property restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the printing or sale of Lutheran writings.\nDejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home in the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic creed of the largest Protestant body in the world.\nThreatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with other Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was averted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish invasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was delayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months earlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead of fear.\nThe circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace, where he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died early on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing himself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.\n\nLuther's lifetime was marked with concern--concern first about himself and God. It wasn't selfish; a man has to find his treasure before he can share it. Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a monastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he found the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's revelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is love instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for himself. It is God's free gift.\nThen his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to keep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of evil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to stop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so soft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the ramparts of his mighty-fortress God.\n\"The devil prefers blockheads,\" he said, therefore, \"the school must be the next thing to the church.\" Concern led him to teach. Professor was the only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who arrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred Scriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were translated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would understand it that way too.\nThe principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the promise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount the humility of his service: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\"",

    "summary": "The chapter \"CHRONOLOGY\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" meticulously outlines the significant milestones and events in the life of Martin Luther, a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. The timeline commences with Luther's birth on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, and traces his journey through education, religious commitment, and his pivotal role in challenging the Catholic Church, culminating in his death on February 18, 1546.\n\nLuther's early life saw a move from Eisleben to Mansfeld in 1484, followed by his education in Magdeburg and Eisenach. In 1501, he entered the University of Erfurt, where he earned a master of arts degree in 1505. His sudden vow to become a monk in July of the same year marked the beginning of his religious career, leading to his entry into the Augustinian cloister in Erfurt and his ordination to the priesthood in 1507.\n\nLuther's academic and theological pursuits continued as he taught in Wittenberg and lectured at the University of Erfurt. His journey to Rome in 1510 and subsequent return to Wittenberg as a professor in 1511 were pivotal in shaping his theological insights. In 1512, he received a doctor of sacred scripture degree, solidifying his academic credentials.\n\nThe year 1517 was a watershed moment in Luther's life and in the history of Christianity when he posted his ninety-five theses, challenging the Catholic Church's practices. This act sparked a series of events, including a summons to Rome in 1518 and a public debate with Eck in Leipzig in 1519. Luther's defiance of the Papal bull in 1520, culminating in his excommunication and the burning of the bull, marked his irrevocable break with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Diet of Worms in 1521, where Luther famously refused to recant his teachings, led to his banishment and subsequent stay at the Wartburg. His return to Wittenberg in 1522 was followed by significant personal and professional developments, including his marriage to Katherine von Bora in 1525 and the composition of \"A Mighty Fortress\" in 1527.\n\nLuther's later years saw continued theological contributions, most notably the publication of the complete Bible in German in 1534, making the scriptures accessible to a broader audience.
