Bryant\n\nThe Royal Observatory, Greenwich 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER I.\n\n\n\n== ASTRONOMY BEFORE KEPLER.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to emphasise the importance of the reforms introduced into\n\nastronomy by Kepler, it will be well to sketch briefly the history of\n\nthe theories which he had to overthrow. In very early times it must have\n\nbeen realised that the sun and moon were continually changing their\n\nplaces among the stars. The day, the month, and the year were obvious\n\ndivisions of time, and longer periods were suggested by the tabulation\n\nof eclipses. We can imagine the respect accorded to the Chaldaean sages\n\nwho first discovered that eclipses could be predicted, and how the\n\nphilosophers of Mesopotamia must have sought eagerly for evidence of\n\nfresh periodic laws. Certain of the stars, which appeared to wander, and\n\nwere hence called planets, provided an extended field for these\n\nspeculations. Among the Chaldaeans and Babylonians the knowledge\n\ngradually acquired was probably confined to the priests and utilised\n\nmainly for astrological prediction or the fixing of religious\n\nobservances. Such speculations as were current among them, and also\n\namong the Egyptians and others who came to share their knowledge, were\n\nalmost entirely devoted to mythology, assigning fanciful terrestrial\n\norigins to constellations, with occasional controversies as to how the\n\nearth is supported in space. The Greeks, too, had an elaborate mythology\n\nlargely adapted from their neighbours, but they were not satisfied with\n\nthis, and made persistent attempts to reduce the apparent motions of\n\ncelestial objects to geometrical laws. Some of the Pythagoreans, if not\n\nPythagoras himself, held that the earth is a sphere, and that the\n\napparent daily revolution of the sun and stars is really due to a motion\n\nof the earth, though at first this motion of the earth was not supposed\n\nto be one of rotation about an axis. These notions, and also that the\n\nplanets on the whole move round from west to east with reference to the\n\nstars, were made known to a larger circle through the writings of Plato.\n\nTo Plato moreover is attributed the challenge to astronomers to\n\nrepresent all the motions of the heavenly bodies by uniformly described\n\ncircles, a challenge generally held responsible for a vast amount of\n\nwasted effort, and the postponement, for many centuries, of real\n\nprogress. Eudoxus of Cnidus, endeavouring to account for the fact that\n\nthe planets, during every apparent revolution round the earth, come to\n\nrest twice, and in the shorter interval between these \"stationary\n\npoints,\" move in the opposite direction, found that he could represent\n\nthe phenomena fairly well by a system of concentric spheres, each\n\nrotating with its own velocity, and carrying its own particular planet\n\nround its own equator, the outermost sphere carrying the fixed stars. It\n\nwas necessary to assume that the axes about which the various spheres\n\nrevolved should have circular motions also, and gradually an increased\n\nnumber of spheres was evolved, the total number required by Aristotle\n\nreaching fifty-five. It may be regarded as counting in Aristotle's\n\nfavour that he did consider the earth to be a sphere and not a flat\n\ndisc, but he seems to have thought that the mathematical spheres of\n\nEudoxus had a real solid existence, and that not only meteors, shooting\n\nstars and aurora, but also comets and the milky way belong to the\n\natmosphere. His really great service to science in collating and\n\ncriticising all that was known of natural science would have been\n\ngreater if so much of the discussion had not been on the exact meaning\n\nof words used to describe phenomena, instead of on the facts and causes\n\nof the phenomena themselves.\n\n\n\nAristarchus of Samos seems to have been the first to suggest that the\n\nplanets revolved not about the earth but about the sun, but the idea\n\nseemed so improbable that it was hardly noticed, especially as\n\nAristarchus himself did not expand it into a treatise.\n\n\n\nAbout this time the necessity for more accurate places of the sun and\n\nmoon, and the liberality of the Ptolemys who ruled Egypt, combined to\n\nprovide regular observations at Alexandria, so that, when Hipparchus\n\ncame upon the scene, there was a considerable amount of material for him\n\nto use. His discoveries marked a great advance in the science of\n\nastronomy. He noted the irregular motion of the sun, and, to explain it,\n\nassumed that it revolved uniformly not exactly about the earth but\n\nabout a point some distance away, called the \"excentric\".[1] The line\n\njoining the centre of the earth to the excentric passes through the\n\napses of the sun's orbit, where its distance from the earth is greatest\n\nand least. The same result he could obtain by assuming that the sun\n\nmoved round a small circle, whose centre described a larger circle about\n\nthe earth; this larger circle carrying the other was called the\n\n\"deferent\": so that the actual motion of the sun was in an epicycle. Of\n\nthe two methods of expression Hipparchus ultimately preferred the\n\nsecond. He applied the same process to the moon but found that he could\n\ndepend upon its being right only at new and full moon. The irregularity\n\nat first and third quarters he left to be investigated by his\n\nsuccessors. He also considered the planetary observations at his\n\ndisposal insufficient and so gave up the attempt at a complete planetary\n\ntheory. He made improved determinations of some of the elements of the\n\nmotions of the sun and moon, and discovered the Precession of the\n\nEquinoxes, from the Alexandrian observations which showed that each year\n\nas the sun came to cross the equator at the vernal equinox it did so at\n\na point about fifty seconds of arc earlier on the ecliptic, thus\n\nproducing in 150 years an unmistakable change of a couple of degrees, or\n\nfour times the sun's diameter. He also invented trigonometry. His star\n\ncatalogue was due to the appearance of a new star which caused him to\n\nsearch for possible previous similar phenomena, and also to prepare for\n\nchecking future ones. No advance was made in theoretical astronomy for\n\n260 years, the interval between Hipparchus and Ptolemy of Alexandria.\n\nPtolemy accepted the spherical form of the earth but denied its rotation\n\nor any other movement. He made no advance on Hipparchus in regard to the\n\nsun, though the lapse of time had largely increased the errors of the\n\nelements adopted by the latter. In the case of the moon, however,\n\nPtolemy traced the variable inequality noticed sometimes by Hipparchus\n\nat first and last quarter, which vanished when the moon was in apogee or\n\nperigee. This he called the evection, and introduced another epicycle\n\nto represent it. In his planetary theory he found that the places given\n\nby his adopted excentric did not fit, being one way at apogee and the\n\nother at perigee; so that the centre of distance must be nearer the\n\nearth. He found it best to assume the centre of distance half-way\n\nbetween the centre of the earth and the excentric, thus \"bisecting the\n\nexcentricity\". Even this did not fit in the case of Mercury, and in\n\ngeneral the agreement between theory and observation was spoilt by the\n\nnecessity of making all the orbital planes pass through the centre of\n\nthe earth, instead of the sun, thus making a good accordance practically\n\nimpossible.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Ptolemy's time very little was heard for many centuries of any\n\nfresh planetary theory, though advances in some points of detail were\n\nmade, notably by some of the Arab philosophers, who obtained improved\n\nvalues for some of the elements by using better instruments. From time\n\nto time various modifications of Ptolemy's theory were suggested, but\n\nnone of any real value. The Moors in Spain did their share of the work\n\ncarried on by their Eastern co-religionists, and the first independent\n\nstar catalogue since the time of Hipparchus was made by another\n\nOriental, Tamerlane's grandson, Ulugh Begh, who built a fine observatory\n\nat Samarcand in the fifteenth century. In Spain the work was not\n\nmonopolised by the Moors, for in the thirteenth century Alphonso of\n\nCastile, with the assistance of Jewish and Christian computers, compiled\n\nthe Alphonsine tables, completed in 1252, in which year he ascended the\n\nthrone as Alphonso X. They were long circulated in MS. and were first\n\nprinted in 1483, not long before the end of the period of stagnation.\n\n\n\nCopernicus was born in 1473 at Thorn in Polish Prussia. In the course of\n\nhis studies at Cracow and at several Italian universities, he learnt all\n\nthat was known of the Ptolemaic astronomy and determined to reform it.\n\nHis maternal uncle, the Bishop of Ermland, having provided him with a\n\nlay canonry in the Cathedral of Frauenburg, he had leisure to devote\n\nhimself to Science. Reviewing the suggestions of the ancient Greeks, he\n\nwas struck by the simplification that would be introduced by reviving\n\nthe idea that the annual motion should be attributed to the earth itself\n\ninstead of having a separate annual epicycle for each planet and for the\n\nsun. Of the seventy odd circles or epicycles required by the latest form\n\nof the Ptolemaic system, Copernicus succeeded in dispensing with rather\n\nmore than half, but he still required thirty-four, which was the exact\n\nnumber assumed before the time of Aristotle. His considerations were\n\nalmost entirely mathematical, his only invasion into physics being in\n\ndefence of the \"moving earth\" against the stock objection that if the\n\nearth moved, loose objects would fly off, and towers fall. He did not\n\nbreak sufficiently away from the old tradition of uniform circular\n\nmotion. Ptolemy's efforts at exactness were baulked, as we have seen, by\n\nthe supposed necessity of all the orbit planes passing through the\n\nearth, and if Copernicus had simply transferred this responsibility to\n\nthe sun he would have done better. But he would not sacrifice the old\n\nfetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with\n\nrespect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the\n\ncentre of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun, thus\n\nhandicapping himself in the same way though not in the same degree as\n\nPtolemy. His thirty-four circles or epicycles comprised four for the\n\nearth, three for the moon, seven for Mercury (on account of his highly\n\neccentric orbit) and five each for the other planets.\n\n\n\nIt is rather an exaggeration to call the present accepted system the\n\nCopernican system, as it is really due to Kepler, half a century after\n\nthe death of Copernicus, but much credit is due to the latter for his\n\nsuccessful attempt to provide a real alternative for the Ptolemaic\n\nsystem, instead of tinkering with it. The old geocentric system once\n\nshaken, the way was gradually smoothed for the heliocentric system,\n\nwhich Copernicus, still hampered by tradition, did not quite reach. He\n\nwas hardly a practical astronomer in the observational sense. His first\n\nrecorded observation, of an occultation of Aldebaran, was made in 1497,\n\nand he is not known to have made as many as fifty astronomical\n\nobservations, while, of the few he did make and use, at least one was\n\nmore than half a degree in error, which would have been intolerable to\n\nsuch an observer as Hipparchus. Copernicus in fact seems to have\n\nconsidered accurate observations unattainable with the instruments at\n\nhand. He refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the\n\ncalendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not\n\nknown with sufficient accuracy. It is possible that with better data he\n\nmight have made much more progress. He was in no hurry to publish\n\nanything, perhaps on account of possible opposition. Certainly Luther,\n\nwith his obstinate conviction of the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures,\n\nrejected as mere folly the idea of a moving earth, and Melanchthon\n\nthought such opinions should be prohibited, but Rheticus, a professor at\n\nthe Protestant University of Wittenberg and an enthusiastic pupil of\n\nCopernicus, urged publication, and undertook to see the work through the\n\npress. This, however, he was unable to complete and another Lutheran,\n\nOsiander, to whom he entrusted it, wrote a preface, with the apparent\n\nintention of disarming opposition, in which he stated that the\n\nprinciples laid down were only abstract hypotheses convenient for\n\npurposes of calculation. This unauthorised interpolation may have had\n\nits share in postponing the prohibition of the book by the Church of\n\nRome.\n\n\n\nAccording to Copernicus the earth is only a planet like the others, and\n\nnot even the biggest one, while the sun is the most important body in\n\nthe system, and the stars probably too far away for any motion of the\n\nearth to affect their apparent places. The earth in fact is very small\n\nin comparison with the distance of the stars, as evidenced by the fact\n\nthat an observer anywhere on the earth appears to be in the middle of\n\nthe universe. He shows that the revolution of the earth will account for\n\nthe seasons, and for the stationary points and retrograde motions of the\n\nplanets. He corrects definitely the order of the planets outwards from\n\nthe sun, a matter which had been in dispute. A notable defect is due to\n\nthe idea that a body can only revolve about another body or a point, as\n\nif rigidly connected with it, so that, in order to keep the earth's axis\n\nin a constant direction in space, he has to invent a third motion. His\n\ndiscussion of precession, which he rightly attributes to a slow motion\n\nof the earth's axis, is marred by the idea that the precession is\n\nvariable. With all its defects, partly due to reliance on bad\n\nobservations, the work showed a great advance in the interpretation of\n\nthe motions of the planets; and his determinations of the periods both\n\nin relation to the earth and to the stars were adopted by Reinhold,\n\nProfessor of Astronomy at Wittenberg, for the new Prutenic or Prussian\n\nTables, which were to supersede the obsolete Alphonsine Tables of the\n\nthirteenth century.\n\n\n\nIn comparison with the question of the motion of the earth, no other\n\nastronomical detail of the time seems to be of much consequence. Comets,\n\nsuch as from time to time appeared, bright enough for naked eye\n\nobservation, were still regarded as atmospheric phenomena, and their\n\nprincipal interest, as well as that of eclipses and planetary\n\nconjunctions, was in relation to astrology. Reform, however, was\n\nobviously in the air. The doctrine of Copernicus was destined very soon\n\nto divide others besides the Lutheran leaders. The leaven of inquiry was\n\nworking, and not long after the death of Copernicus real advances were\n\nto come, first in the accuracy of observations, and, as a necessary\n\nresult of these, in the planetary theory itself.\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER II.\n\n\n\n== EARLY LIFE OF KEPLER.\n\n\n\nOn 21st December, 1571, at Weil in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, was born a\n\nweak and sickly seven-months' child, to whom his parents Henry and\n\nCatherine Kepler gave the name of John. Henry Kepler was a petty officer\n\nin the service of the reigning Duke, and in 1576 joined the army serving\n\nin the Netherlands. His wife followed him, leaving her young son in his\n\ngrandfather's care at Leonberg, where he barely recovered from a severe\n\nattack of smallpox. It was from this place that John derived the\n\nLatinised name of Leonmontanus, in accordance with the common practice\n\nof the time, but he was not known by it to any great extent. He was sent\n\nto school in 1577, but in the following year his father returned to\n\nGermany, almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he\n\nhad become surety. Henry Kepler was obliged to sell his house and most\n\nof his belongings, and to keep a tavern at Elmendingen, withdrawing his\n\nson from school to help him with the rough work. In 1583 young Kepler\n\nwas sent to the school at Elmendingen, and in 1584 had another narrow\n\nescape from death by a violent illness. In 1586 he was sent, at the\n\ncharges of the Duke, to the monastic school of Maulbronn; from whence,\n\nin accordance with the school regulations, he passed at the end of his\n\nfirst year the examination for the bachelor's degree at Tübingen,\n\nreturning for two more years as a \"veteran\" to Maulbronn before being\n\nadmitted as a resident student at Tübingen. The three years thus spent\n\nat Maulbronn were marked by recurrences of several of the diseases from\n\nwhich he had suffered in childhood, and also by family troubles at his\n\nhome. His father went away after a quarrel with his wife Catherine, and\n\ndied abroad. Catherine herself, who seems to have been of a very\n\nunamiable disposition, next quarrelled with her own relatives. It is not\n\nsurprising therefore that Kepler after taking his M.A. degree in August,\n\n1591, coming out second in the examination lists, was ready to accept\n\nthe first appointment offered him, even if it should involve leaving\n\nhome. This happened to be the lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, the\n\nchief town in Styria. Kepler's knowledge of astronomy was limited to the\n\ncompulsory school course, nor had he as yet any particular leaning\n\ntowards the science; the post, moreover, was a meagre and unimportant\n\none. On the other hand he had frequently expressed disgust at the way in\n\nwhich one after another of his companions had refused \"foreign\"\n\nappointments which had been arranged for them under the Duke's scheme of\n\neducation. His tutors also strongly urged him to accept the lectureship,\n\nand he had not the usual reluctance to leave home. He therefore\n\nproceeded to Gratz, protesting that he did not thereby forfeit his claim\n\nto a more promising opening, when such should appear. His astronomical\n\ntutor, Maestlin, encouraged him to devote himself to his newly adopted\n\nscience, and the first result of this advice appeared before very long\n\nin Kepler's \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\". The bent of his mind was towards\n\nphilosophical speculation, to which he had been attracted in his\n\nyouthful studies of Scaliger's \"Exoteric Exercises\". He says he devoted\n\nmuch time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of\n\ngenii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of\n\nfountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents\n\nand inland seas, and things of this sort\". Following his tutor in his\n\nadmiration for the Copernican theory, he wrote an essay on the primary\n\nmotion, attributing it to the rotation of the earth, and this not for\n\nthe mathematical reasons brought forward by Copernicus, but, as he\n\nhimself says, on physical or metaphysical grounds. In 1595, having more\n\nleisure from lectures, he turned his speculative mind to the number,\n\nsize, and motion of the planetary orbits. He first tried simple\n\nnumerical relations, but none of them appeared to be twice, thrice, or\n\nfour times as great as another, although he felt convinced that there\n\nwas some relation between the motions and the distances, seeing that\n\nwhen a gap appeared in one series, there was a corresponding gap in the\n\nother. These gaps he attempted to fill by hypothetical planets between\n\nMars and Jupiter, and between Mercury and Venus, but this method also\n\nfailed to provide the regular proportion which he sought, besides being\n\nopen to the objection that on the same principle there might be many\n\nmore equally invisible planets at either end of the series. He was\n\nnevertheless unwilling to adopt the opinion of Rheticus that the number\n\nsix was sacred, maintaining that the \"sacredness\" of the number was of\n\nmuch more recent date than the creation of the worlds, and could not\n\ntherefore account for it. He next tried an ingenious idea, comparing the\n\nperpendiculars from different points of a quadrant of a circle on a\n\ntangent at its extremity. The greatest of these, the tangent, not being\n\ncut by the quadrant, he called the line of the sun, and associated with\n\ninfinite force. The shortest, being the point at the other end of the\n\nquadrant, thus corresponded to the fixed stars or zero force;\n\nintermediate ones were to be found proportional to the \"forces\" of the\n\nsix planets. After a great amount of unfinished trial calculations,\n\nwhich took nearly a whole summer, he convinced himself that success did\n\nnot lie that way. In July, 1595, while lecturing on the great planetary\n\nconjunctions, he drew quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac showing the\n\nslow progression of these points of conjunction at intervals of just\n\nover 240° or eight signs. The successive chords marked out a smaller\n\ncircle to which they were tangents, about half the diameter of the\n\nzodiacal circle as drawn, and Kepler at once saw a similarity to the\n\norbits of Saturn and Jupiter, the radius of the inscribed circle of an\n\nequilateral triangle being half that of the circumscribed circle. His\n\nnatural sequence of ideas impelled him to try a square, in the hope that\n\nthe circumscribed and inscribed circles might give him a similar\n\n\"analogy\" for the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. He next tried a pentagon\n\nand so on, but he soon noted that he would never reach the sun that way,\n\nnor would he find any such limitation as six, the number of \"possibles\"\n\nbeing obviously infinite. The actual planets moreover were not even six\n\nbut only five, so far as he knew, so he next pondered the question of\n\nwhat sort of things these could be of which only five different figures\n\nwere possible and suddenly thought of the five regular solids.[2] He\n\nimmediately pounced upon this idea and ultimately evolved the following\n\nscheme. \"The earth is the sphere, the measure of all; round it describe\n\na dodecahedron; the sphere including this will be Mars. Round Mars\n\ndescribe a tetrahedron; the sphere including this will be Jupiter.\n\nDescribe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere including this will be Saturn.\n\nNow, inscribe in the earth an icosahedron, the sphere inscribed in it\n\nwill be Venus: inscribe an octahedron in Venus: the circle inscribed in\n\nit will be Mercury.\" With this result Kepler was inordinately pleased,\n\nand regretted not a moment of the time spent in obtaining it, though to\n\nus this \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" can only appear useless, even without\n\nthe more recent additions to the known planets. He admitted that a\n\ncertain thickness must be assigned to the intervening spheres to cover\n\nthe greatest and least distances of the several planets from the sun,\n\nbut even then some of the numbers obtained are not a very close fit for\n\nthe corresponding planetary orbits. Kepler's own suggested explanation\n\nof the discordances was that they must be due to erroneous measures of\n\nthe planetary distances, and this, in those days of crude and infrequent\n\nobservations, could not easily be disproved. He next thought of a\n\nvariety of reasons why the five regular solids should occur in precisely\n\nthe order given and in no other, diverging from this into a subtle and\n\nnot very intelligible process of reasoning to account for the division\n\nof the zodiac into 360°. The next subject was more important, and dealt\n\nwith the relation between the distances of the planets and their times\n\nof revolution round the sun. It was obvious that the period was not\n\nsimply proportional to the distance, as the outer planets were all too\n\nslow for this, and he concluded \"either that the moving intelligences of\n\nthe planets are weakest in those that are farthest from the sun, or that\n\nthere is one moving intelligence in the sun, the common centre, forcing\n\nthem all round, but those most violently which are nearest, and that it\n\nlanguishes in some sort and grows weaker at the most distant, because of\n\nthe remoteness and the attenuation of the virtue\". This is not so near a\n\nguess at the theory of gravitation as might be supposed, for Kepler\n\nimagined that a repulsive force was necessary to account for the planets\n\nbeing sometimes further from the sun, and so laid aside the idea of a\n\nconstant attractive force. He made several other attempts to find a law\n\nconnecting the distances and periods of the planets, but without success\n\nat that time, and only desisted when by unconsciously arguing in a\n\ncircle he appeared to get the same result from two totally different\n\nhypotheses. He sent copies of his book to several leading astronomers,\n\nof whom Galileo praised his ingenuity and good faith, while Tycho Brahe\n\nwas evidently much struck with the work and advised him to adapt\n\nsomething similar to the Tychonic system instead of the Copernican. He\n\nalso intimated that his Uraniborg observations would provide more\n\naccurate determinations of the planetary orbits, and thus made Kepler\n\neager to visit him, a project which as we shall see was more than\n\nfulfilled. Another copy of the book Kepler sent to Reymers the Imperial\n\nastronomer with a most fulsome letter, which Tycho, who asserted that\n\nReymers had simply plagiarised his work, very strongly resented, thus\n\ndrawing from Kepler a long letter of apology. About the same time Kepler\n\nhad married a lady already twice widowed, and become involved in\n\ndifficulties with her relatives on financial grounds, and with the\n\nStyrian authorities in connection with the religious disputes then\n\ncoming to a head. On account of these latter he thought it expedient,\n\nthe year after his marriage, to withdraw to Hungary, from whence he sent\n\nshort treatises to Tübingen, \"On the magnet\" (following the ideas of\n\nGilbert of Colchester), \"On the cause of the obliquity of the ecliptic\"\n\nand \"On the Divine wisdom as shown in the Creation\". His next important\n\nstep makes it desirable to devote a chapter to a short notice of Tycho\n\nBrahe.\n\n\n\n[Footnote 2: Since the sum of the plane angles at a corner of a regular\n\nsolid must be less than four right angles, it is easily seen that few\n\nregular solids are possible. Hexagonal faces are clearly impossible, or\n\nany polygonal faces with more than five sides. The possible forms are\n\nthe dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces, three meeting at each\n\ncorner; the cube, six square faces, three meeting at each corner; and\n\nthree figures with triangular faces, the tetrahedron of four faces,\n\nthree meeting at each corner; the octahedron of eight faces, four\n\nmeeting at each corner; and the icosahedron of twenty faces, five\n\nmeeting at each corner.]\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER III.\n\n\n\n== TYCHO BRAHE.\n\n\n\nThe age following that of Copernicus produced three outstanding figures\n\nassociated with the science of astronomy, then reaching the close of\n\nwhat Professor Forbes so aptly styles the geometrical period. These\n\nthree Sir David Brewster has termed \"Martyrs of Science\"; Galileo, the\n\ngreat Italian philosopher, has his own place among the \"Pioneers of\n\nScience\"; and invaluable though Tycho Brahe's work was, the latter can\n\nhardly be claimed as a pioneer in the same sense as the other two.\n\nNevertheless, Kepler, the third member of the trio, could not have made\n\nhis most valuable discoveries without Tycho's observations.\n\n\n\nOf noble family, born a twin on 14th December, 1546, at Knudstrup in\n\nScania (the southernmost part of Sweden, then forming part of the\n\nkingdom of Denmark), Tycho was kidnapped a year later by a childless\n\nuncle. This uncle brought him up as his own son, provided him at the age\n\nof seven with a tutor, and sent him in 1559 to the University of\n\nCopenhagen, to study for a political career by taking courses in\n\nrhetoric and philosophy. On 21st August, 1560, however, a solar eclipse\n\ntook place, total in Portugal, and therefore of small proportions in\n\nDenmark, and Tycho's keen interest was awakened, not so much by the\n\nphenomenon, as by the fact that it had occurred according to prediction.\n\nSoon afterwards he purchased an edition of Ptolemy in order to read up\n\nthe subject of astronomy, to which, and to mathematics, he devoted most\n\nof the remainder of his three years' course at Copenhagen. His uncle\n\nnext sent him to Leipzig to study law, but he managed to continue his\n\nastronomical researches. He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic\n\nTables, but soon found that the latter, though more accurate than the\n\nformer, failed to represent the true positions of the planets, and\n\ngrasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to\n\ndetermine the true motions. He began by observing a conjunction of\n\nJupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found the Prutenic Tables\n\nseveral days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month. He provided\n\nhimself with a cross-staff for determining the angular distance between\n\nstars or other objects, and, finding the divisions of the scale\n\ninaccurate, constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that\n\nseems to have been a decided innovation, the previous practice having\n\nbeen to use the best available instrument and ignore its errors. About\n\nthis time war broke out between Denmark and Sweden, and Tycho returned\n\nto his uncle, who was vice-admiral and attached to the king's suite. The\n\nuncle died in the following month, and early in the next year Tycho went\n\nabroad again, this time to Wittenberg. After five months, however, an\n\noutbreak of plague drove him away, and he matriculated at Rostock, where\n\nhe found little astronomy but a good deal of astrology. While there he\n\nfought a duel in the dark and lost part of his nose, which he replaced\n\nby a composition of gold and silver. He carried on regular observations\n\nwith his cross-staff and persevered with his astronomical studies in\n\nspite of the objections and want of sympathy of his fellow-countrymen.\n\nThe King of Denmark, however, having a higher opinion of the value of\n\nscience, promised Tycho the first canonry that should fall vacant in the\n\ncathedral chapter of Roskilde, so that he might be assured of an income\n\nwhile devoting himself to financially unproductive work. In 1568 Tycho\n\nleft Rostock, and matriculated at Basle, but soon moved on to Augsburg,\n\nwhere he found more enthusiasm for astronomy, and induced one of his new\n\nfriends to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant of heavy\n\noak beams. This was the first of the series of great instruments\n\nassociated with Tycho's name, and it remained in use for five years,\n\nbeing destroyed by a great storm in 1574. Tycho meanwhile had left\n\nAugsburg in 1570 and returned to live with his father, now governor of\n\nHelsingborg Castle, until the latter's death in the following year.\n\nTycho then joined his mother's brother, Steen Bille, the only one of his\n\nrelatives who showed any sympathy with his desire for a scientific\n\ncareer.\n\n\n\nOn 11th November, 1572, Tycho noticed an unfamiliar bright star in the\n\nconstellation of Cassiopeia, and continued to observe it with a sextant.\n\nIt was a very brilliant object, equal to Venus at its brightest for the\n\nrest of November, not falling below the first magnitude for another four\n\nmonths, and remaining visible for more than a year afterwards. Tycho\n\nwrote a little book on the new star, maintaining that it had practically\n\nno parallax, and therefore could not be, as some supposed, a comet.\n\nDeeming authorship beneath the dignity of a noble he was very reluctant\n\nto publish, but he was convinced of the importance of increasing the\n\nnumber and accuracy of observations, though he was by no means free from\n\nall the erroneous ideas of his time. The little book contained a certain\n\namount of astrology, but Tycho evidently did not regard this as of very\n\ngreat importance. He adopted the view that the very rarity of the\n\nphenomenon of a new star must prevent the formulation and adoption of\n\ndefinite rules for determining its significance. We gather from lectures\n\nwhich he was persuaded to deliver at the University of Copenhagen that,\n\nthough in agreement with the accepted canons of astrology as to the\n\ninfluence of planetary conjunctions and such phenomena on the course of\n\nhuman events, he did not consider the fate predicted by anyone's\n\nhoroscope to be unavoidable, but thought the great value of astrology\n\nlay in the warnings derived from such computations, which should enable\n\nthe believer to avoid threatened calamities. In 1575 he left Denmark\n\nonce more and made his way to Cassel, where he found a kindred spirit in\n\nthe studious Landgrave, William IV. of Hesse, whose astronomical\n\npursuits had been interrupted by his accession to the government of\n\nHesse, in 1567. Tycho observed with him for some time, the two forming a\n\nfirm friendship, and then visited successively Frankfort, Basle, and\n\nVenice, returning by way of Augsburg, Ratisbon, and Saalfeld to\n\nWittenberg; on the way he acquired various astronomical manuscripts,\n\nmade friends among practical astronomers, and examined new instruments.\n\nHe seemed to have considered the advantages of the several places thus\n\nvisited and decided on Basle, but on his return to Denmark to fetch his\n\nfamily with the object of transferring them to Basle, he found that his\n\nfriend the Landgrave had written to King Frederick on his behalf,\n\nurging him to provide the means to enable Tycho to pursue his\n\nastronomical work, promising that not only should credit result for the\n\nking and for Denmark but that science itself would be greatly advanced.\n\nThe ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various\n\noffers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of\n\nHveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large\n\nsum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far\n\nremoved from the distractions of court life. Here Tycho built his\n\ncelebrated observatory of Uraniborg and began observations in December,\n\n1576, using the large instruments then found necessary in order to\n\nattain the accuracy of observation which within the next half-century\n\nwas to be so greatly facilitated by the invention of the telescope. Here\n\nalso he built several smaller observing rooms, so that his pupils should\n\nbe able to observe independently. For more than twenty years he\n\ncontinued his observations at Uraniborg, surrounded by his family, and\n\nattracting numerous pupils. His constant aim was to accumulate a large\n\nstore of observations of a high order of accuracy, and thus to provide\n\ndata for the complete reform of astronomy. As we have seen, few of the\n\nDanish nobles had any sympathy with Tycho's pursuits, and most of them\n\nstrongly resented the continual expense borne by the King's treasury.\n\nTycho moreover was so absorbed in his scientific pursuits that he would\n\nnot take the trouble to be a good landlord, nor to carry out all the\n\nduties laid upon him in return for certain of his grants of income. His\n\nbuildings included a chemical laboratory, and he was in the habit of\n\nmaking up elixirs for various medical purposes; these were quite\n\npopular, particularly as he made no charge for them. He seems to have\n\nbeen something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulphur to cure\n\ninfectious diseases \"brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora\n\nBorealis\"!\n\n\n\nKing Frederick, in consideration of various grants to Tycho, relied\n\nupon his assistance in scientific matters, and especially in\n\nastrological calculations; such as the horoscope of the heir apparent,\n\nPrince Christian, born in 1577, which has been preserved among Tycho's\n\nwritings. There is, however, no known copy in existence of any of the\n\nseries of annual almanacs with predictions which he prepared for the\n\nKing. In November, 1577, appeared a bright comet, which Tycho carefully\n\nobserved with his sextant, proving that it had no perceptible parallax,\n\nand must therefore be further off than the moon. He thus definitely\n\noverthrew the common belief in the atmospheric origin of comets, which\n\nhe had himself hitherto shared. With increasing accuracy he observed\n\nseveral other comets, notably one in 1585, when he had a full equipment\n\nof instruments and a large staff of assistants. The year 1588, which saw\n\nthe death of his royal benefactor, saw also the publication of a volume\n\nof Tycho's great work \"Introduction to the New Astronomy\". The first\n\nvolume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the\n\nreduction of the observations involved so much research to correct the\n\nstar places for refraction, precession, etc.; it was not completed in\n\nfact until Tycho's death, but the second volume, dealing with the comet\n\nof 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588.\n\nBesides the comet observations it included an account of Tycho's system\n\nof the world. He would not accept the Copernican system, as he\n\nconsidered the earth too heavy and sluggish to move, and also that the\n\nauthority of Scripture was against such an hypothesis. He therefore\n\nassumed that the other planets revolved about the sun, while the sun,\n\nmoon, and stars revolved about the earth as a centre. Geometrically this\n\nis much the same as the Copernican system, but physically it involves\n\nthe grotesque demand that the whole system of stars revolves round our\n\ninsignificant little earth every twenty-four hours. Since his previous\n\nsmall book on the comet, Tycho had evidently considered more fully its\n\npossible astrological significance, for he foretold a religious war,\n\ngiving the date of its commencement, and also the rising of a great\n\nProtestant champion. These predictions were apparently fulfilled almost\n\nto the letter by the great religious wars that broke out towards the end\n\nof the sixteenth century, and in the person of Gustavus Adolphus.\n\n\n\nKing Frederick's death did not at first affect Tycho's position, for the\n\nnew king, Christian, was only eleven years old, and for some years the\n\ncouncil of regents included two of his supporters. After their deaths,\n\nhowever, his emoluments began to be cut down on the plea of economy, and\n\nas he took very little trouble to carry out any other than scientific\n\nduties it was easy enough for his enemies to find fault. One after\n\nanother source of income was cut off, but he persevered with his\n\nscientific work, including a catalogue of stars. He had obtained plenty\n\nof good observations of 777 stars, but thought his catalogue should\n\ncontain 1000 stars, so he hastily observed as many more as he could up\n\nto the time of his leaving Hveen, though even then he had not completed\n\nhis programme. About the time that King Christian reached the age of\n\neighteen, Tycho began to look about for a new patron, and to consider\n\nthe prospects offered by transferring himself with his instruments and\n\nactivities to the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II. In 1597, when\n\neven his pension from the Royal treasury was cut off, he hurriedly\n\npacked up his instruments and library, and after a few weeks' sojourn at\n\nCopenhagen, proceeded to Rostock, in Mecklenburg, whence he sent an\n\nappeal to King Christian. It is possible that had he done this before\n\nleaving Hveen it might have had more effect, but it can be readily seen\n\nfrom the tone of the king's unfavourable reply that his departure was\n\nregarded as an aggravation of previous shortcomings. Driven from Rostock\n\nby the plague, Tycho settled temporarily at Wandsbeck, in Holstein, but\n\ntowards the end of 1598 set out to meet the Emperor at Prague. Once\n\nmore plague intervened and he spent some time at Dresden, afterwards\n\ngoing to Wittenberg for the winter. He ultimately reached Prague in\n\nJune, 1599. Rudolph granted him a salary of at least 3000 florins,\n\npromising also to settle on him the first hereditary estate that should\n\nlapse to the Crown. He offered, moreover, the choice between three\n\ncastles outside Prague, of which Tycho chose Benatek. There he set about\n\naltering the buildings in readiness for his instruments, for which he\n\nsent to Uraniborg. Before they reached him, after many vexatious delays,\n\nhe had given up waiting for the funds promised for his building\n\nexpenses, and removed from Benatek to Prague. It was during this\n\ninterval that after considerable negotiation, Kepler, who had been in\n\ncorrespondence with Tycho, consented to join him as an assistant.\n\nAnother assistant, Longomontanus, who had been with Tycho at Uraniborg,\n\nwas finding difficulty with the long series of Mars observations, and it\n\nwas arranged that he should transfer his energies to the lunar\n\nobservations, leaving those of Mars for Kepler. Before very much could\n\nbe done with them, however, Tycho died at the end of October, 1601. He\n\nmay have regretted the peaceful island of Hveen, considering the\n\ntroubles in which Bohemia was rapidly becoming involved, but there is\n\nlittle doubt that had it not been for his self-imposed exile, his\n\nobservations would not have come into Kepler's hands, and their great\n\nvalue might have been lost. In any case it was at Uraniborg that the\n\nmass of observations was produced upon which the fame of Tycho Brahe\n\nrests. His own discoveries, though in themselves the most important made\n\nin astronomy for many centuries, are far less valuable than those for\n\nwhich his observations furnished the material. He discovered the third\n\nand fourth inequalities of the moon in longitude, called respectively\n\nthe variation and the annual equation, also the variability of the\n\nmotion of the moon's nodes and the inclination of its orbit to the\n\necliptic. He obtained an improved value of the constant of precession,\n\nand did good service by rejecting the idea that it was variable, an idea\n\nwhich, under the name of trepidation, had for many centuries been\n\naccepted. He discovered the effect of refraction, though only\n\napproximately its amount, and determined improved values of many other\n\nastronomical constants, but singularly enough made no determination of\n\nthe distance of the sun, adopting instead the ancient and erroneous\n\nvalue given by Hipparchus.\n\n\n\nHis magnificent Observatory of Uraniborg, the finest building for\n\nastronomical purposes that the world had hitherto seen, was allowed to\n\nfall into decay, and scarcely more than mere indications of the site may\n\nnow be seen.\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\n== KEPLER JOINS TYCHO.\n\n\n\nThe association of Kepler with Tycho was one of the most important\n\nlandmarks in the history of astronomy. The younger man hoped, by the aid\n\nof Tycho's planetary observations, to obtain better support for some of\n\nhis fanciful speculative theories, while the latter, who had certainly\n\nnot gained in prestige by leaving Denmark, was in great need of a\n\ncompetent staff of assistants. Of the two it would almost seem that\n\nTycho thought himself the greater gainer, for in spite of his reputation\n\nfor brusqueness and want of consideration, he not only made light of\n\nKepler's apology in the matter of Reymers, but treated him with uniform\n\nkindness in the face of great rudeness and ingratitude. He begged him to\n\ncome \"as a welcome friend,\" though Kepler, very touchy on the subject of\n\nhis own astronomical powers, was afraid he might be regarded as simply a\n\nsubordinate assistant. An arrangement had been suggested by which Kepler\n\nshould obtain two years' leave of absence from Gratz on full pay, which,\n\nbecause of the higher cost of living in Prague, should be supplemented\n\nby the Emperor; but before this could be concluded, Kepler threw up his\n\nprofessorship, and thinking he had thereby also lost the chance of going\n\nto Prague, applied to Maestlin and others of his Tübingen friends to\n\nmake interest for him with the Duke of Wurtemberg and secure the\n\nprofessorship of medicine. Tycho, however, still urged him to come to\n\nPrague, promising to do his utmost to secure for him a permanent\n\nappointment, or in any event to see that he was not the loser by coming.\n\nKepler was delayed by illness on the way, but ultimately reached Prague,\n\naccompanied by his wife, and for some time lived entirely at Tycho's\n\nexpense, writing by way of return essays against Reymers and another\n\nman, who had claimed the credit of the Tychonic system. This Kepler\n\ncould do with a clear conscience, as it was only a question of priority\n\nand did not involve any support of the system, which he deemed far\n\ninferior to that of Copernicus. The following year saw friction between\n\nthe two astronomers, and we learn from Kepler's abject letter of apology\n\nthat he was entirely in the wrong. It was about money matters, which in\n\none way or another embittered the rest of Kepler's life, and it arose\n\nduring his absence from Prague. On his return in September, 1601, Tycho\n\npresented him to the Emperor, who gave him the title of Imperial\n\nMathematician, on condition of assisting Tycho in his calculations, the\n\nvery thing Kepler was most anxious to be allowed to do: for nowhere else\n\nin the world was there such a collection of good observations sufficient\n\nfor his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy. The\n\nEmperor's interest was still mainly with astrology, but he liked to\n\nthink that his name would be handed down to posterity in connection\n\nwith the new Planetary Tables in the same way as that of Alphonso of\n\nCastile, and he made liberal promises to pay the expenses. Tycho's other\n\nprincipal assistant, Longomontanus, did not stay long after giving up\n\nthe Mars observations to Kepler, but instead of working at the new lunar\n\ntheory, suddenly left to take up a professorship of astronomy in his\n\nnative Denmark. Very shortly afterwards Tycho himself died of acute\n\ndistemper; Kepler began to prepare the mass of manuscripts for\n\npublication, but, as everything was claimed by the Brahe family, he was\n\nnot allowed to finish the work. He succeeded to Tycho's post of\n\nprincipal mathematician to the Emperor, at a reduced official salary,\n\nwhich owing to the emptiness of the Imperial treasury was almost always\n\nin arrear. In order to meet his expenses he had recourse to the casting\n\nof nativities, for which he gained considerable reputation and received\n\nvery good pay. He worked by the conventional rules of astrology, and was\n\nquite prepared to take fees for so doing, although he had very little\n\nfaith in them, preferring his own fanciful ideas.\n\n\n\nIn 1604 the constellation of Cassiopeia was once more temporarily\n\nenriched by the appearance of a new star, said by some to be brighter\n\nthan Tycho's nova, and by others to be twice as bright as Jupiter.\n\nKepler at once wrote a short account of it, from which may be gathered\n\nsome idea of his attitude towards astrology. Contrasting the two novae,\n\nhe says: \"Yonder one chose for its appearance a time no way remarkable,\n\nand came into the world quite unexpectedly, like an enemy storming a\n\ntown and breaking into the market-place before the citizens are aware of\n\nhis approach; but ours has come exactly in the year of which astrologers\n\nhave written so much about the fiery trigon that happens in it; just in\n\nthe month in which (according to Cyprian), Mars comes up to a very\n\nperfect conjunction with the other two superior planets; just in the day\n\nwhen Mars has joined Jupiter, and just in the region where this\n\nconjunction has taken place. Therefore the apparition of this star is\n\nnot like a secret hostile irruption, as was that one of 1572, but the\n\nspectacle of a public triumph, or the entry of a mighty potentate; when\n\nthe couriers ride in some time before to prepare his lodgings, and the\n\ncrowd of young urchins begin to think the time over long to wait, then\n\nroll in, one after another, the ammunition and money, and baggage\n\nwaggons, and presently the trampling of horse and the rush of people\n\nfrom every side to the streets and windows; and when the crowd have\n\ngazed with their jaws all agape at the troops of knights; then at last\n\nthe trumpeters and archers and lackeys so distinguish the person of the\n\nmonarch, that there is no occasion to point him out, but every one cries\n\nof his own accord--'Here we have him'. What it may portend is hard to\n\ndetermine, and this much only is certain, that it comes to tell mankind\n\neither nothing at all or high and mighty news, quite beyond human sense\n\nand understanding. It will have an important influence on political and\n\nsocial relations; not indeed by its own nature, but as it were\n\naccidentally through the disposition of mankind. First, it portends to\n\nthe booksellers great disturbances and tolerable gains; for almost every\n\n_Theologus_, _Philosophicus_, _Medicus_, and _Mathematicus_, or whoever\n\nelse, having no laborious occupation entrusted to him, seeks his\n\npleasure _in studiis_, will make particular remarks upon it, and will\n\nwish to bring these remarks to the light. Just so will others, learned\n\nand unlearned, wish to know its meaning, and they will buy the authors\n\nwho profess to tell them. I mention these things merely by way of\n\nexample, because although thus much can be easily predicted without\n\ngreat skill, yet may it happen just as easily, and in the same manner,\n\nthat the vulgar, or whoever else is of easy faith, or, it may be, crazy,\n\nmay wish to exalt himself into a great prophet; or it may even happen\n\nthat some powerful lord, who has good foundation and beginning of great\n\ndignities, will be cheered on by this phenomenon to venture on some new\n\nscheme, just as if God had set up this star in the darkness merely to\n\nenlighten them.\" He made no secret of his views on conventional\n\nastrology, as to which he claimed to speak with the authority of one\n\nfully conversant with its principles, but he nevertheless expressed his\n\nsincere conviction that the conjunctions and aspects of the planets\n\ncertainly did affect things on the earth, maintaining that he was driven\n\nto this belief against his will by \"most unfailing experiences\".\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the projected Rudolphine Tables were continually delayed by\n\nthe want of money. Kepler's nominal salary should have been ample for\n\nhis expenses, increased though they were by his growing family, but in\n\nthe depleted state of the treasury there were many who objected to any\n\npayment for such \"unpractical\" purposes. This particular attitude has\n\nnot been confined to any special epoch or country, but the obvious\n\nresult in Kepler's case was to compel him to apply himself to less\n\nexpensive matters than the Planetary Tables, and among these must be\n\nincluded not only the horoscopes or nativities, which owing to his\n\nreputation were always in demand, but also other writings which probably\n\ndid not pay so well. In 1604 he published \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\"\n\ncontaining the earliest known reasonable theory of optics, and\n\nespecially of dioptrics or vision through lenses. He compared the\n\nmechanism of the eye with that of Porta's \"Camera Obscura,\" but made no\n\nattempt to explain how the image formed on the retina is understood by\n\nthe brain. He went carefully into the question of refraction, the\n\nimportance of which Tycho had been the first astronomer to recognise,\n\nthough he only applied it at low altitudes, and had not arrived at a\n\ntrue theory or accurate values. Kepler wasted a good deal of time and\n\ningenuity on trial theories. He would invariably start with some\n\nhypothesis, and work out the effect. He would then test it by\n\nexperiment, and when it failed would at once recognise that his\n\nhypothesis was _a priori_ bound to fail. He rarely seems to have noticed\n\nthe fatal objections in time to save himself trouble. He would then at\n\nonce start again on a new hypothesis, equally gratuitous and equally\n\nunfounded. It never seems to have occurred to him that there might be a\n\nbetter way of approaching a problem. Among the lines he followed in this\n\nparticular investigation were, first, that refraction depends only on\n\nthe angle of incidence, which, he says, cannot be correct as it would\n\nthus be the same for all refracting substances; next, that it depended\n\nalso on the density of the medium. This was a good shot, but he\n\nunfortunately assumed that all rays passing into a denser medium would\n\napparently penetrate it to a depth depending only on the medium, which\n\nmeans that there is a constant ratio between the tangents, instead of\n\nthe sines, of the inclination of the incident and refracted rays to the\n\nnormal. Experiment proved that this gave too high values for refraction\n\nnear the vertical compared with those near the horizon, so Kepler \"went\n\noff at a tangent\" and tried a totally new set of ideas, which all\n\nreduced to the absurdity of a refraction which vanished at the horizon.\n\nThese were followed by another set, involving either a constant amount\n\nof refraction or one becoming infinite. He then came to the conclusion\n\nthat these geometrical methods must fail because the refracted image is\n\nnot real, and determined to try by analogy only, comparing the equally\n\nunreal image formed by a mirror with that formed by refraction in water.\n\nHe noticed how the bottom of a vessel containing water appears to rise\n\nmore and more away from the vertical, and at once jumped to the analogy\n\nof a concave mirror, which magnifies the image, while a convex mirror\n\nwas likened to a rarer medium. This line of attack also failed him, as\n\ndid various attempts to find relations between his measurements of\n\nrefraction and conic sections, and he broke off suddenly with a diatribe\n\nagainst Tycho's critics, whom he likened to blind men disputing about\n\ncolours. Not many years later Snell discovered the true law of\n\nrefraction, but Kepler's contribution to the subject, though he failed\n\nto discover the actual law, includes several of the adopted \"by-laws\".\n\nHe noted that atmospheric refraction would alter with the height of the\n\natmosphere and with temperature, and also recognised the fact that\n\nrainbow colours depend on the angle of refraction, whether seen in the\n\nrainbow itself, or in dew, glass, water, or any similar medium. He thus\n\ncame near to anticipating Newton. Before leaving the subject of Kepler's\n\noptics it will be well to recall that a few years later after hearing of\n\nGalileo's telescope, Kepler suggested that for astronomical purposes two\n\nconvex lenses should be used, so that there should be a real image where\n\nmeasuring wires could be placed for reference. He did not carry out the\n\nidea himself, and it was left to the Englishman Gascoigne to produce the\n\nfirst instrument on this \"Keplerian\" principle, universally known as the\n\nAstronomical Telescope.\n\n\n\nIn 1606 came a second treatise on the new star, discussing various\n\ntheories to account for its appearance, and refusing to accept the\n\nnotion that it was a \"fortuitous concourse of atoms\". This was followed\n\nin 1607 by a treatise on comets, suggested by the comet appearing that\n\nyear, known as Halley's comet after its next return. He regarded comets\n\nas \"planets\" moving in straight lines, never having examined sufficient\n\nobservations of any comet to convince himself that their paths are\n\ncurved. If he had not assumed that they were external to the system and\n\nso could not be expected to return, he might have anticipated Halley's\n\ndiscovery. Another suggestive remark of his was to the effect that the\n\nplanets must be self-luminous, as otherwise Mercury and Venus, at any\n\nrate, ought to show phases. This was put to the test not long afterwards\n\nby means of Galileo's telescope.\n\n\n\nIn 1607 Kepler rushed into print with an alleged observation of Mercury\n\ncrossing the sun, but after Galileo's discovery of sun-spots, Kepler at\n\nonce cheerfully retracted his observation of \"Mercury,\" and so far was\n\nhe from being annoyed or bigoted in his views, that he warmly adopted\n\nGalileo's side, in contrast to most of those whose opinions were liable\n\nto be overthrown by the new discoveries. Maestlin and others of Kepler's\n\nfriends took the opposite view.\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER V.\n\n\n\n== KEPLER'S LAWS.\n\n\n\nWhen Gilbert of Colchester, in his \"New Philosophy,\" founded on his\n\nresearches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that\n\nthe moon attracted the water, but that \"subterranean spirits and\n\nhumours, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise\n\nand flow to the shores and up rivers\". It appears that an idea,\n\npresented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a\n\nplain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very\n\ngenerally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo's admiration for\n\nGilbert's work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of\n\nmagnetic attraction to the planets. The general idea of \"gravity\"\n\nopposed the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth on the ground that\n\nloose objects would fly off: moreover, the latest refinements of the old\n\nsystem of planetary motions necessitated their orbits being described\n\nabout a mere empty point. Kepler very strongly combated these notions,\n\npointing out the absurdity of the conclusions to which they tended, and\n\nproceeded in set terms to describe his own theory.\n\n\n\n\"Every corporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a\n\nnatural fitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by\n\nitself beyond the sphere of influence of a body cognate with it. Gravity\n\nis a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or\n\nconjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth\n\nattracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy\n\nbodies (if we begin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the\n\nworld) are not carried to the centre of the world in its quality of\n\ncentre of the world, but as to the centre of a cognate round body,\n\nnamely, the earth; so that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or\n\nwhithersoever it may be carried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will\n\nalways be carried towards it. If the earth were not round, heavy bodies\n\nwould not tend from every side in a straight line towards the centre of\n\nthe earth, but to different points from different sides. If two stones\n\nwere placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the\n\nsphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two\n\nmagnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each\n\napproaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of\n\nthe other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by\n\ntheir animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to\n\nthe moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall\n\ntowards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would\n\nthere meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same\n\ndensity. If the earth should cease to attract its waters to itself all\n\nthe waters of the sea would he raised and would flow to the body of the\n\nmoon. The sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends\n\nas far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies\n\nrapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a\n\nflow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward.\n\nIf the attractive virtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it\n\nfollows with greater reason that the attractive virtue of the earth\n\nextends as far as the moon and much farther; and, in short, nothing\n\nwhich consists of earthly substance anyhow constituted although thrown\n\nup to any height, can ever escape the powerful operation of this\n\nattractive virtue. Nothing which consists of corporeal matter is\n\nabsolutely light, but that is comparatively lighter which is rarer,\n\neither by its own nature, or by accidental heat. And it is not to be\n\nthought that light bodies are escaping to the surface of the universe\n\nwhile they are carried upwards, or that they are not attracted by the\n\nearth. They are attracted, but in a less degree, and so are driven\n\noutwards by the heavy bodies; which being done, they stop, and are kept\n\nby the earth in their own place. But although the attractive virtue of\n\nthe earth extends upwards, as has been said, so very far, yet if any\n\nstone should be at a distance great enough to become sensible compared\n\nwith the earth's diameter, it is true that on the motion of the earth\n\nsuch a stone would not follow altogether; its own force of resistance\n\nwould be combined with the attractive force of the earth, and thus it\n\nwould extricate itself in some degree from the motion of the earth.\" The\n\nabove passage from the Introduction to Kepler's \"Commentaries on the\n\nMotion of Mars,\" always regarded as his most valuable work, must have\n\nbeen known to Newton, so that no such incident as the fall of an apple\n\nwas required to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the\n\ngenesis of his Theory of Universal Gravitation. Kepler's glimpse at such\n\na theory could have been no more than a glimpse, for he went no further\n\nwith it. This seems a pity, as it is far less fanciful than many of his\n\nideas, though not free from the \"virtues\" and \"animal faculties,\" that\n\ncorrespond to Gilbert's \"spirits and humours\". We must, however, proceed\n\nto the subject of Mars, which was, as before noted, the first important\n\ninvestigation entrusted to Kepler on his arrival at Prague.\n\n\n\nThe time taken from one opposition of Mars to the next is decidedly\n\nunequal at different parts of his orbit, so that many oppositions must\n\nbe used to determine the mean motion. The ancients had noticed that what\n\nwas called the \"second inequality,\" due as we now know to the orbital\n\nmotion of the earth, only vanished when earth, sun, and planet were in\n\nline, i.e. at the planet's opposition; therefore they used oppositions\n\nto determine the mean motion, but deemed it necessary to apply a\n\ncorrection to the true opposition to reduce to mean opposition, thus\n\nsacrificing part of the advantage of using oppositions. Tycho and\n\nLongomontanus had followed this method in their calculations from\n\nTycho's twenty years' observations. Their aim was to find a position of\n\nthe \"equant,\" such that these observations would show a constant angular\n\nmotion about it; and that the computed positions would agree in latitude\n\nand longitude with the actual observed positions. When Kepler arrived he\n\nwas told that their longitudes agreed within a couple of minutes of arc,\n\nbut that something was wrong with the latitudes. He found, however, that\n\neven in longitude their positions showed discordances ten times as great\n\nas they admitted, and so, to clear the ground of assumptions as far as\n\npossible, he determined to use true oppositions. To this Tycho objected,\n\nand Kepler had great difficulty in convincing him that the new move\n\nwould be any improvement, but undertook to prove to him by actual\n\nexamples that a false position of the orbit could by adjusting the\n\nequant be made to fit the longitudes within five minutes of arc, while\n\ngiving quite erroneous values of the latitudes and second inequalities.\n\nTo avoid the possibility of further objection he carried out this\n\ndemonstration separately for each of the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus,\n\nand Tycho. For the new method he noticed that great accuracy was\n\nrequired in the reduction of the observed places of Mars to the\n\necliptic, and for this purpose the value obtained for the parallax by\n\nTycho's assistants fell far short of the requisite accuracy. Kepler\n\ntherefore was obliged to recompute the parallax from the original\n\nobservations, as also the position of the line of nodes and the\n\ninclination of the orbit. The last he found to be constant, thus\n\ncorroborating his theory that the plane of the orbit passed through the\n\nsun. He repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times (and that\n\nbefore the invention of logarithms), and at length adopted values for\n\nthe mean longitude and longitude of aphelion. He found no discordance\n\ngreater than two minutes of arc in Tycho's observed longitudes in\n\nopposition, but the latitudes, and also longitudes in other parts of the\n\norbit were much more discordant, and he found to his chagrin that four\n\nyears' work was practically wasted. Before making a fresh start he\n\nlooked for some simplification of the labour; and determined to adopt\n\nPtolemy's assumption known as the principle of the bisection of the\n\nexcentricity. Hitherto, since Ptolemy had given no reason for this\n\nassumption, Kepler had preferred not to make it, only taking for granted\n\nthat the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity\n\n(see Figs. 1, 2).\n\n\n\nA marked improvement in residuals was the result of this step, proving,\n\nso far, the correctness of Ptolemy's principle, but there still remained\n\ndiscordances amounting to eight minutes of arc. Copernicus, who had no\n\nidea of the accuracy obtainable in observations, would probably have\n\nregarded such an agreement as remarkably good; but Kepler refused to\n\nadmit the possibility of an error of eight minutes in any of Tycho's\n\nobservations. He thereupon vowed to construct from these eight minutes a\n\nnew planetary theory that should account for them all. His repeated\n\nfailures had by this time convinced him that no uniformly described\n\ncircle could possibly represent the motion of Mars. Either the orbit\n\ncould not be circular, or else the angular velocity could not be\n\nconstant about any point whatever. He determined to attack the \"second\n\ninequality,\" i.e. the optical illusion caused by the earth's annual\n\nmotion, but first revived an old idea of his own that for the sake of\n\nuniformity the sun, or as he preferred to regard it, the earth, should\n\nhave an equant as well as the planets. From the irregularities of the\n\nsolar motion he soon found that this was the case, and that the motion\n\nwas uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the centre of the\n\nearth's orbit, such that the centre bisected the distance from the sun\n\nto the \"Equant\"; this fully supported Ptolemy's principle. Clearly then\n\nthe earth's linear velocity could not be constant, and Kepler was\n\nencouraged to revive another of his speculations as to a force which was\n\nweaker at greater distances. He found the velocity greater at the nearer\n\napse, so that the time over an equal arc at either apse was proportional\n\nto the distance. He conjectured that this might prove to be true for\n\narcs at all parts of the orbit, and to test this he divided the orbit\n\ninto 360 equal parts, and calculated the distances to the points of\n\ndivision. Archimedes had obtained an approximation to the area of a\n\ncircle by dividing it radially into a very large number of triangles,\n\nand Kepler had this device in mind. He found that the sums of successive\n\ndistances from his 360 points were approximately proportional to the\n\ntimes from point to point, and was thus enabled to represent much more\n\naccurately the annual motion of the earth which produced the second\n\ninequality of Mars, to whose motion he now returned. Three points are\n\nsufficient to define a circle, so he took three observed positions of\n\nMars and found a circle; he then took three other positions, but\n\nobtained a different circle, and a third set gave yet another. It thus\n\nbegan to appear that the orbit could not be a circle. He next tried to\n\ndivide into 360 equal parts, as he had in the case of the earth, but the\n\nsums of distances failed to fit the times, and he realised that the sums\n\nof distances were not a good measure of the area of successive\n\ntriangles. He noted, however, that the errors at the apses were now\n\nsmaller than with a central circular orbit, and of the opposite sign, so\n\nhe determined to try whether an oval orbit would fit better, following a\n\nsuggestion made by Purbach in the case of Mercury, whose orbit is even\n\nmore eccentric than that of Mars, though observations were too scanty to\n\nform the foundation of any theory. Kepler gave his fancy play in the\n\nchoice of an oval, greater at one end than the other, endeavouring to\n\nsatisfy some ideas about epicyclic motion, but could not find a\n\nsatisfactory curve. He then had the fortunate idea of trying an ellipse\n\nwith the same axis as his tentative oval. Mars now appeared too slow at\n\nthe apses instead of too quick, so obviously some intermediate ellipse\n\nmust be sought between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same\n\naxis. At this point the \"long arm of coincidence\" came into play.\n\nHalf-way between the apses lay the mean distance, and at this position\n\nthe error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle,\n\namounting to .00429 of a radius. With these figures in his mind, Kepler\n\nlooked up the greatest optical inequality of Mars, the angle between the\n\nstraight lines from Mars to the Sun and to the centre of the circle.[3]\n\nThe secant of this angle was 1.00429, so that he noted that an ellipse\n\nreduced from the circle in the ratio of 1.00429 to 1 would fit the\n\nmotion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.\n\n\n\n[Footnote 3: This is clearly a maximum at AMC in Fig. 2, when its\n\ntangent AC/CM = the eccentricity.]\n\n\n\nIt is often said that a coincidence like this only happens to somebody\n\nwho \"deserves his luck,\" but this simply means that recognition is\n\nessential to the coincidence. In the same way the appearance of one of a\n\nlarge number of people mentioned is hailed as a case of the old adage\n\n\"Talk of the devil, etc.,\" ignoring all the people who failed to appear.\n\nNo one, however, will consider Kepler unduly favoured. His genius, in\n\nhis case certainly \"an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" enabled him\n\nout of his medley of hypotheses, mainly unsound, by dint of enormous\n\nlabour and patience, to arrive thus at the first two of the laws which\n\nestablished his title of \"Legislator of the Heavens\".\n\n\n\nFIGURES EXPLANATORY OF KEPLER'S THEORY OF THE MOTION OF MARS.\n\n\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\n\n\n\n    _______\n\n   /       \\\n\n  /         \\\n\n |           |\n\n |___________|\n\nQ|  E  C  A  |P\n\n |           |\n\n  \\         /\n\n   \\_______/\n\n\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\n\n\n\n    ___M___\n\n   /___|\\__\\\n\n  //  N|\\\\ \\\\\n\n |/    | \\\\ \\|\n\n |_____|__\\\\_|\n\nQ| E   C   A |P\n\n |\\    |    /|\n\n  \\\\___|___//\n\n   \\___|___/\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: Approximate renditions of these figures are\n\nprovided. Fig. 1 is a circle. Fig. 2 is a circle which contains an\n\nellipse, tangent to the circle at Q and P. Line segments from M (on the\n\ncircle) and N (on the ellipse) meet at point A.]\n\n\n\nFIG. 1.--In Ptolemy's excentric theory, A may be taken to represent the\n\nearth, C the centre of a planet's orbit, and E the equant, P (perigee)\n\nand Q (apogee) being the apses of the orbit. Ptolemy's idea was that\n\nuniform motion in a circle must be provided, and since the motion was\n\nnot uniform about the earth, A could not coincide with C; and since the\n\nmotion still failed to be uniform about A or C, some point E must be\n\nfound about which the motion should be uniform.\n\n\n\nFIG. 2.--This is not drawn to scale, but is intended to illustrate\n\nKepler's modification of Ptolemy's excentric. Kepler found velocities at\n\nP and Q proportional not to AP and AQ but to AQ and AP, or to EP and EQ\n\nif EC = CA (bisection of the excentricity). The velocity at M was wrong,\n\nand AM appeared too great. Kepler's first ellipse had M moved too near\n\nC. The distance AC is much exaggerated in the figure, as also is MN.\n\nAN = CP, the radius of the circle. MN should be .00429 of the radius,\n\nand MC/NC should be 1.00429. The velocity at N appeared to be\n\nproportional to EN ( = AN). Kepler concluded that Mars moved round PNQ,\n\nso that the area described about A (the sun) was equal in equal times, A\n\nbeing the focus of the ellipse PNQ. The angular velocity is not quite\n\nconstant about E, the equant or empty focus, but the difference could\n\nhardly have been detected in Kepler's time.\n\n\n\nKepler's improved determination of the earth's orbit was obtained by\n\nplotting the different positions of the earth corresponding to\n\nsuccessive rotations of Mars, i.e. intervals of 687 days. At each of\n\nthese the date of the year would give the angle MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth),\n\nand Tycho's observation the angle MES. So the triangle could be solved\n\nexcept for scale, and the ratio of SE to SM would give the distance of\n\nMars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed\n\nposition of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE,\n\nshowing the earth's inequality. Measuring from a fixed position of the\n\nearth, it would give similarly a series of positions of Mars, which,\n\nthough lying not far from the circle whose diameter was the axis of\n\nMars' orbit, joining perihelion and aphelion, always fell inside the\n\ncircle except at those two points. It was a long time before it dawned\n\nupon Kepler that the simplest figure falling within the circle except at\n\nthe two extremities of the diameter, was an ellipse, and it is not clear\n\nwhy his first attempt with an ellipse should have been just as much too\n\nnarrow as the circle was too wide. The fact remains that he recognised\n\nsuddenly that halving this error was tantamount to reducing the circle\n\nto the ellipse whose eccentricity was that of the old theory, i.e. that\n\nin which the sun would be in one focus and the equant in the other.\n\n\n\nHaving now fitted the ends of both major and minor axes of the ellipse,\n\nhe leaped to the conclusion that the orbit would fit everywhere.\n\n\n\nThe practical effect of his clearing of the \"second inequality\" was to\n\nrefer the orbit of Mars directly to the sun, and he found that the area\n\nbetween successive distances of Mars from the sun (instead of the sum of\n\nthe distances) was strictly proportional to the time taken, in short,\n\nequal areas were described in equal times (2nd Law) when referred to the\n\nsun in the focus of the ellipse (1st Law).\n\n\n\nHe announced that (1) The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in\n\none focus; and (2) The straight line joining the planet to the sun\n\nsweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time. These are\n\nKepler's first and second Laws though not discovered in that order, and\n\nit was at once clear that Ptolemy's \"bisection of the excentricity\"\n\nsimply amounted to the fact that the centre of an ellipse bisects the\n\ndistance between the foci, the sun being in one focus and the angular\n\nvelocity being uniform about the empty focus. For so many centuries had\n\nthe fetish of circular motion postponed discovery. It was natural that\n\nKepler should assume that his laws would apply equally to all the\n\nplanets, but the proof of this, as well as the reason underlying the\n\nlaws, was only given by Newton, who approached the subject from a\n\ntotally different standpoint.\n\n\n\nThis commentary on Mars was published in 1609, the year of the invention\n\nof the telescope, and Kepler petitioned the Emperor for further funds to\n\nenable him to complete the study of the other planets, but once more\n\nthere was delay; in 1612 Rudolph died, and his brother Matthias who\n\nsucceeded him, cared very little for astronomy or even astrology, though\n\nKepler was reappointed to his post of Imperial Mathematician. He left\n\nPrague to take up a permanent professorship at the University of Linz.\n\nHis own account of the circumstances is gloomy enough. He says, \"In the\n\nfirst place I could get no money from the Court, and my wife, who had\n\nfor a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was\n\ntaken violently ill towards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever,\n\nepilepsy and phrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three\n\nchildren were at once attacked with smallpox. Leopold with his army\n\noccupied the town beyond the river just as I lost the dearest of my\n\nsons, him whose nativity you will find in my book on the new star. The\n\ntown on this side of the river where I lived was harassed by the\n\nBohemian troops, whose new levies were insubordinate and insolent; to\n\ncomplete the whole, the Austrian army brought the plague with them into\n\nthe city. I went into Austria and endeavoured to procure the situation\n\nwhich I now hold. Returning in June, I found my wife in a decline from\n\nher grief at the death of her son, and on the eve of an infectious\n\nfever, and I lost her also within eleven days of my return. Then came\n\nfresh annoyance, of course, and her fortune was to be divided with my\n\nstep-sisters. The Emperor Rudolph would not agree to my departure; vain\n\nhopes were given me of being paid from Saxony; my time and money were\n\nwasted together, till on the death of the Emperor in 1612, I was named\n\nagain by his successor, and suffered to depart to Linz.\"\n\n\n\nBeing thus left a widower with a ten-year-old daughter Susanna, and a\n\nboy Louis of half her age, he looked for a second wife to take charge of\n\nthem. He has given an account of eleven ladies whose suitability he\n\nconsidered. The first, an intimate friend of his first wife, ultimately\n\ndeclined; one was too old, another an invalid, another too proud of her\n\nbirth and quarterings, another could do nothing useful, and so on.\n\nNumber eight kept him guessing for three months, until he tired of her\n\nconstant indecision, and confided his disappointment to number nine, who\n\nwas not impressed. Number ten, introduced by a friend, Kepler found\n\nexceedingly ugly and enormously fat, and number eleven apparently too\n\nyoung. Kepler then reconsidered one of the earlier ones, disregarding\n\nthe advice of his friends who objected to her lowly station. She was the\n\norphan daughter of a cabinetmaker, educated for twelve years by favour\n\nof the Lady of Stahrenburg, and Kepler writes of her: \"Her person and\n\nmanners are suitable to mine; no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to\n\nwork; she has a tolerable knowledge of how to manage a family;\n\nmiddle-aged and of a disposition and capability to acquire what she\n\nstill wants\".\n\n\n\nWine from the Austrian vineyards was plentiful and cheap at the time of\n\nthe marriage, and Kepler bought a few casks for his household. When the\n\nseller came to ascertain the quantity, Kepler noticed that no proper\n\nallowance was made for the bulging parts, and the upshot of his\n\nobjections was that he wrote a book on a new method of gauging--one of\n\nthe earliest specimens of modern analysis, extending the properties of\n\nplane figures to segments of cones and cylinders as being \"incorporated\n\ncircles\". He was summoned before the Diet at Ratisbon to give his\n\nopinion on the Gregorian Reform of the Calendar, and soon afterwards was\n\nexcommunicated, having fallen foul of the Roman Catholic party at Linz\n\njust as he had previously at Gratz, the reason apparently being that he\n\ndesired to think for himself. Meanwhile his salary was not paid any more\n\nregularly than before, and he was forced to supplement it by publishing\n\nwhat he called a \"vile prophesying almanac which is scarcely more\n\nrespectable than begging unless it be because it saves the Emperor's\n\ncredit, who abandons me entirely, and with all his frequent and recent\n\norders in council, would suffer me to perish with hunger\".\n\n\n\nIn 1617 he was invited to Italy to succeed Magini as Professor of\n\nMathematics at Bologna. Galileo urged him to accept the post, but he\n\nexcused himself on the ground that he was a German and brought up among\n\nGermans with such liberty of speech as he thought might get him into\n\ntrouble in Italy. In 1619 Matthias died and was succeeded by Ferdinand\n\nIII, who again retained Kepler in his post. In the same year Kepler\n\nreprinted his \"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" and also published his\n\n\"Harmonics\" in five books dedicated to James I of England. \"The first\n\ngeometrical, on the origin and demonstration of the laws of the figures\n\nwhich produce harmonious proportions; the second, architectonical, on\n\nfigurate geometry and the congruence of plane and solid regular figures;\n\nthe third, properly Harmonic, on the derivation of musical proportions\n\nfrom figures, and on the nature and distinction of things relating to\n\nsong, in opposition to the old theories; the fourth, metaphysical,\n\npsychological, and astrological, on the mental essence of Harmonics, and\n\nof their kinds in the world, especially on the harmony of rays emanating\n\non the earth from the heavenly bodies, and on their effect in nature and\n\non the sublunary and human soul; the fifth, astronomical and\n\nmetaphysical, on the very exquisite Harmonics of the celestial motions\n\nand the origin of the excentricities in harmonious proportions.\" The\n\nextravagance of his fancies does not appear until the fourth book, in\n\nwhich he reiterates the statement that he was forced to adopt his\n\nastrological opinions from direct and positive observation. He despises\n\n\"The common herd of prophesiers who describe the operations of the stars\n\nas if they were a sort of deities, the lords of heaven and earth, and\n\nproducing everything at their pleasure. They never trouble themselves to\n\nconsider what means the stars have of working any effects among us on\n\nthe earth whilst they remain in the sky and send down nothing to us\n\nwhich is obvious to the senses, except rays of light.\" His own notion is\n\n\"Like one who listens to a sweet melodious song, and by the gladness of\n\nhis countenance, by his voice, and by the beating of his hand or foot\n\nattuned to the music, gives token that he perceives and approves the\n\nharmony: just so does sublunary nature, with the notable and evident\n\nemotion of the bowels of the earth, bear like witness to the same\n\nfeelings, especially at those times when the rays of the planets form\n\nharmonious configurations on the earth,\" and again \"The earth is not an\n\nanimal like a dog, ready at every nod; but more like a bull or an\n\nelephant, slow to become angry, and so much the more furious when\n\nincensed.\" He seems to have believed the earth to be actually a living\n\nanimal, as witness the following: \"If anyone who has climbed the peaks\n\nof the highest mountains, throw a stone down their very deep clefts, a\n\nsound is heard from them; or if he throw it into one of the mountain\n\nlakes, which beyond doubt are bottomless, a storm will immediately\n\narise, just as when you thrust a straw into the ear or nose of a\n\nticklish animal, it shakes its head, or runs shudderingly away. What so\n\nlike breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their\n\nmouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful\n\ntide! For although it is so regulated according to the course of the\n\nmoon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have\n\nmentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon, as\n\niron by the loadstone, yet if anyone uphold that the earth regulates its\n\nbreathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as animals have\n\ndaily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall not think\n\nhis philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if any flexible\n\nparts should be discovered in the depths of the earth, to supply the\n\nfunctions of lungs or gills.\"\n\n\n\nIn the same book Kepler enlarges again on his views in reference to the\n\nbasis of astrology as concerned with nativities and the importance of\n\nplanetary conjunctions. He gives particulars of his own nativity.\n\n\"Jupiter nearest the nonagesimal had passed by four degrees the trine of\n\nSaturn; the Sun and Venus in conjunction were moving from the latter\n\ntowards the former, nearly in sextiles with both: they were also\n\nremoving from quadratures with Mars, to which Mercury was closely\n\napproaching: the moon drew near to the trine of the same planet, close\n\nto the Bull's Eye even in latitude. The 25th degree of Gemini was\n\nrising, and the 22nd of Aquarius culminating. That there was this triple\n\nconfiguration on that day--namely the sextile of Saturn and the Sun,\n\nthe sextile of Mars and Jupiter, and the quadrature of Mercury and Mars,\n\nis proved by the change of weather; for after a frost of some days, that\n\nvery day became warmer, there was a thaw and a fall of rain.\" This\n\nalleged \"proof\" is interesting as it relies on the same principle which\n\nwas held to justify the correction of an uncertain birth-time, by\n\nreference to illnesses, etc., met with later. Kepler however goes on to\n\nsay, \"If I am to speak of the results of my studies, what, I pray, can I\n\nfind in the sky, even remotely alluding to it? The learned confess that\n\nseveral not despicable branches of philosophy have been newly extricated\n\nor amended or brought to perfection by me: but here my constellations\n\nwere, not Mercury from the East in the angle of the seventh, and in\n\nquadratures with Mars, but Copernicus, but Tycho Brahe, without whose\n\nbooks of observations everything now set by me in the clearest light\n\nmust have remained buried in darkness; not Saturn predominating Mercury,\n\nbut my lords the Emperors Rudolph and Matthias, not Capricorn the house\n\nof Saturn but Upper Austria, the house of the Emperor, and the ready and\n\nunexampled bounty of his nobles to my petition. Here is that corner, not\n\nthe western one of the horoscope, but on the earth whither, by\n\npermission of my Imperial master, I have betaken myself from a too\n\nuneasy Court; and whence, during these years of my life, which now tends\n\ntowards its setting, emanate these Harmonics and the other matters on\n\nwhich I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\nThe fifth book contains a great deal of nonsense about the harmony of\n\nthe spheres; the notes contributed by the several planets are gravely\n\nset down, that of Mercury having the greatest resemblance to a melody,\n\nthough perhaps more reminiscent of a bugle-call. Yet the book is not all\n\nworthless for it includes Kepler's Third Law, which he had diligently\n\nsought for years. In his own words, \"The proportion existing between the\n\nperiodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate\n\nproportion of the mean distances of the orbits,\" or as generally given,\n\n\"the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the\n\nmean distances.\" Kepler was evidently transported with delight and\n\nwrote, \"What I prophesied two and twenty years ago, as soon as I\n\ndiscovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits,--what I firmly\n\nbelieved long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'--what I had\n\npromised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I\n\nwas sure of my discovery,--what sixteen years ago I urged as a thing to\n\nbe sought,--that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in\n\nPrague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to\n\nastronomical computations, at length I have brought to light, and have\n\nrecognised its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations. Great as is\n\nthe absolute nature of Harmonics, with all its details as set forth in\n\nmy third book, it is all found among the celestial motions, not indeed\n\nin the manner which I imagined (that is not the least part of my\n\ndelight), but in another very different, and yet most perfect and\n\nexcellent. It is now eighteen months since I got the first glimpse of\n\nlight, three months since the dawn, very few days since the unveiled\n\nsun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing holds me; I\n\nwill indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the\n\nhonest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians\n\nto build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt.\n\nIf you forgive me, I rejoice, if you are angry, I can bear it; the die\n\nis cast, the book is written; to be read either now or by posterity, I\n\ncare not which; it may well wait a century for a reader, as God has\n\nwaited six thousand years for an observer.\" He gives the date 15th May,\n\n1618, for the completion of his discovery. In his \"Epitome of the\n\nCopernican Astronomy,\" he gives his own idea as to the reason for this\n\nThird Law. \"Four causes concur for lengthening the periodic time. First,\n\nthe length of the path; secondly, the weight or quantity of matter to be\n\ncarried; thirdly, the degree of strength of the moving virtue; fourthly,\n\nthe bulk or space into which is spread out the matter to be moved. The\n\norbital paths of the planets are in the simple ratio of the distances;\n\nthe weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the\n\nsubduplicate ratio of the same distances, as has been already proved; so\n\nthat with every increase of distance a planet has more matter and\n\ntherefore is moved more slowly, and accumulates more time in its\n\nrevolution, requiring already, as it did, more time by reason of the\n\nlength of the way. The third and fourth causes compensate each other in\n\na comparison of different planets; the simple and subduplicate\n\nproportion compound the sesquiplicate proportion, which therefore is the\n\nratio of the periodic times.\" The only part of this \"explanation\" that\n\nis true is that the paths are in the simple ratio of the distances, the\n\n\"proof\" so confidently claimed being of the circular kind commonly known\n\nas \"begging the question\". It was reserved for Newton to establish the\n\nLaws of Motion, to find the law of force that would constrain a planet\n\nto obey Kepler's first and second Laws, and to prove that it must\n\ntherefore also obey the third.\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\n== CLOSING YEARS.\n\n\n\nSoon after its publication Kepler's \"Epitome\" was placed along with the\n\nbook of Copernicus, on the list of books prohibited by the Congregation\n\nof the Index at Rome, and he feared that this might prevent the\n\npublication or sale of his books in Austria also, but was told that\n\nthough Galileo's violence was getting him into trouble, there would be\n\nno difficulty in obtaining permission for learned men to read any\n\nprohibited books, and that he (Kepler) need fear nothing so long as he\n\nremained quiet.\n\n\n\nIn his various works on Comets, he adhered to the opinion that they\n\ntravelled in straight lines with varying velocity. He suggested that\n\ncomets come from the remotest parts of ether, as whales and monsters\n\nfrom the depth of the sea, and that perhaps they are something of the\n\nnature of silkworms, and are wasted and consumed in spinning their own\n\ntails. Napier's invention of logarithms at once attracted Kepler's\n\nattention. He must have regretted that the discovery was not made early\n\nenough to save him a vast amount of labour in computations, but he\n\nmanaged to find time to compute some logarithm tables for himself,\n\nthough he does not seem to have understood quite what Napier had done,\n\nand though with his usual honesty he gave full credit to the Scottish\n\nbaron for his invention.\n\n\n\nThough Eugenists may find a difficulty in reconciling Napier's\n\nbrilliancy with the extreme youth of his parents, they may at any rate\n\nattribute Kepler's occasional fits of bad temper to heredity. His\n\ncantankerous mother, Catherine Kepler, had for some years been carrying\n\non an action for slander against a woman who had accused her of\n\nadministering a poisonous potion. Dame Kepler employed a young advocate\n\nwho for reasons of his own \"nursed\" the case so long that after five\n\nyears had elapsed without any conclusion being reached another judge was\n\nappointed, who had himself suffered from the caustic tongue of the\n\nprosecutrix, and so was already prejudiced against her. The defendant,\n\nknowing this, turned the tables on her opponent by bringing an\n\naccusation of witchcraft against her, and Catherine Kepler was\n\nimprisoned and condemned to the torture in July, 1620. Kepler, hearing\n\nof the sentence, hurried back from Linz, and succeeded in stopping the\n\ncompletion of the sentence, securing his mother's release the following\n\nyear, as it was made clear that the only support for the case against\n\nher was her own intemperate language. Kepler returned to Linz, and his\n\nmother at once brought another action for costs and damages against her\n\nlate opponent, but died before the case could be tried.\n\n\n\nA few months before this Sir Henry Wotton, English Ambassador to Venice,\n\nvisited Kepler, and finding him as usual, almost penniless, urged him to\n\ngo to England, promising him a warm welcome there. Kepler, however,\n\nwould not at that time leave Germany, giving several reasons, one of\n\nwhich was that he dreaded the confinement of an island. Later on he\n\nexpressed his willingness to go as soon as his Rudolphine Tables were\n\npublished, and lecture on them, even in England, if he could not do it\n\nin Germany, and if a good enough salary were forthcoming.\n\n\n\nIn 1624 he went to Vienna, and managed to extract from the Treasury 6000\n\nflorins on account of expenses connected with the Tables, but, instead\n\nof a further grant, was given letters to the States of Swabia, which\n\nowed money to the Imperial treasury. Some of this he succeeded in\n\ncollecting, but the Tables were still further delayed by the religious\n\ndisturbances then becoming violent. The Jesuits contrived to have\n\nKepler's library sealed up, and, but for the Imperial protection, would\n\nhave imprisoned him also; moreover the peasants revolted and blockaded\n\nLinz. In 1627, however, the long promised Tables, the first to discard\n\nthe conventional circular motion, were at last published at Ulm in four\n\nparts. Two of these parts consisted of subsidiary Tables, of logarithms\n\nand other computing devices, another contained Tables of the elements of\n\nthe sun, moon, and planets, and the fourth gave the places of a thousand\n\nstars as determined by Tycho, with Tycho's refraction Tables, which had\n\nthe peculiarity of using different values for the refraction of the sun,\n\nmoon, and stars. From a map prefixed to some copies of the Tables, we\n\nmay infer that Kepler was one of the first, if not actually the first,\n\nto suggest the method of determining differences of longitude by\n\noccultations of stars at the moon's limb. In an Appendix, he showed how\n\nhis Tables could be used by astrologers for their predictions, saying\n\n\"Astronomy is the daughter of Astrology, and this modern Astrology again\n\nis the daughter of Astronomy, bearing something of the lineaments of her\n\ngrandmother; and, as I have already said, this foolish daughter,\n\nAstrology, supports her wise but needy mother, Astronomy, from the\n\nprofits of a profession not generally considered creditable\". There is\n\nno doubt that Kepler strongly resented having to depend so much for his\n\nincome on such methods which he certainly did not consider creditable.\n\n\n\nIt was probably Galileo whose praise of the new Tables induced the Grand\n\nDuke of Tuscany to send Kepler a gold chain soon after their\n\npublication, and we may perhaps regard it as a mark of favour from the\n\nEmperor Ferdinand that he permitted Kepler to attach himself to the\n\ngreat Wallenstein, now Duke of Friedland, and a firm believer in\n\nAstrology. The Duke was a better paymaster than either of the three\n\nsuccessive Emperors. He furnished Kepler with an assistant and a\n\nprinting press; and obtained for him the Professorship of Astronomy at\n\nthe University of Rostock in Mecklenburg. Apparently, however, the\n\nEmperor could not induce Wallenstein to take over the responsibility of\n\nthe 8000 crowns, still owing from the Imperial treasury on account of\n\nthe Rudolphine Tables. Kepler made a last attempt to secure payment at\n\nRatisbon, but his journey thither brought disappointment and fatigue and\n\nleft him in such a condition that he rapidly succumbed to an attack of\n\nfever, dying in November, 1630, in his fifty-ninth year. His body was\n\nburied at Ratisbon, but the tombstone was destroyed during the war then\n\nraging. His daughter, Susanna, the wife of Jacob Bartsch, a physician\n\nwho had helped Kepler with his Ephemeris, lost her husband soon after\n\nher father's death, and succeeded in obtaining part of Kepler's arrears\n\nof salary by threatening to keep Tycho's manuscripts, but her\n\nstepmother was left almost penniless with five young children. For their\n\nbenefit Louis Kepler printed a \"Dream of Lunar Astronomy,\" which first\n\nhis father and then his brother-in-law had been preparing for\n\npublication at the time of their respective deaths. It is a curious\n\nmixture of saga and fairy tale with a little science in the way of\n\nastronomy studied from the moon, and cast in the form of a dream to\n\novercome the practical difficulties of the hypothesis of visiting the\n\nmoon. Other writings in large numbers were left unpublished. No attempt\n\nat a complete edition of Kepler's works was made for a long time. One\n\nwas projected in 1714 by his biographer, Hantsch, but all that appeared\n\nwas one volume of letters. After various learned bodies had declined to\n\nmove in the matter the manuscripts were purchased for the Imperial\n\nRussian library. An edition was at length brought out at Frankfort by C.\n\nFrisch, in eight volumes, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870.\n\n\n\nKepler's fame does not rest upon his voluminous works. With his peculiar\n\nmethod of approaching problems there was bound to be an inordinate\n\namount of chaff mixed with the grain, and he used no winnowing machine.\n\nHis simplicity and transparent honesty induced him to include\n\neverything, in fact he seemed to glory in the number of false trails he\n\nlaboriously followed. He was one who might be expected to find the\n\nproverbial \"needle in a haystack,\" but unfortunately the needle was not\n\nalways there. Delambre says, \"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish\n\nhimself by his discoveries he attempted everything, and having once\n\nobtained a glimpse of one, no labour was too hard for him in following\n\nor verifying it. All his attempts had not the same success, and in fact\n\nthat was impossible. Those which have failed seem to us only fanciful;\n\nthose which have been more fortunate appear sublime. When in search of\n\nthat which really existed, he has sometimes found it; when he devoted\n\nhimself to the pursuit of a chimera, he could not but fail, but even\n\nthen he unfolded the same qualities, and that obstinate perseverance\n\nthat must triumph over all difficulties but those which are\n\ninsurmountable.\" Berry, in his \"Short History of Astronomy,\" says \"as\n\none reads chapter after chapter without a lucid, still less a correct\n\nidea, it is impossible to refrain from regrets that the intelligence of\n\nKepler should have been so wasted, and it is difficult not to suspect at\n\ntimes that some of the valuable results which lie embedded in this great\n\nmass of tedious speculation were arrived at by a mere accident. On the\n\nother hand it must not be forgotten that such accidents have a habit of\n\nhappening only to great men, and that if Kepler loved to give reins to\n\nhis imagination he was equally impressed with the necessity of\n\nscrupulously comparing speculative results with observed facts, and of\n\nsurrendering without demur the most beloved of his fancies if it was\n\nunable to stand this test. If Kepler had burnt three-quarters of what he\n\nprinted, we should in all probability have formed a higher opinion of\n\nhis intellectual grasp and sobriety of judgment, but we should have lost\n\nto a great extent the impression of extraordinary enthusiasm and\n\nindustry, and of almost unequalled intellectual honesty which we now get\n\nfrom a study of his works.\"\n\n\n\nProfessor Forbes is more enthusiastic. In his \"History of Astronomy,\" he\n\nrefers to Kepler as \"the man whose place, as is generally agreed, would\n\nhave been the most difficult to fill among all those who have\n\ncontributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge,\" and again _à\n\npropos_ of Kepler's great book, \"it must be obvious that he had at that\n\ntime some inkling of the meaning of his laws--universal gravitation.\n\nFrom that moment the idea of universal gravitation was in the air, and\n\nhints and guesses were thrown out by many; and in time the law of\n\ngravitation would doubtless have been discovered, though probably not by\n\nthe work of one man, even if Newton had not lived. But, if Kepler had\n\nnot lived, who else could have discovered his Laws?\"\n\n\n\n= End",

            "text": "In order to emphasise the importance of the reforms introduced into astronomy by Kepler, it will be well to sketch briefly the history of the theories which he had to overthrow. In very early times it must have been realised that the sun and moon were continually changing their places among the stars. The day, the month, and the year were obvious divisions of time, and longer periods were suggested by the tabulation of eclipses. We can imagine the respect accorded to the Chaldaean sages who first discovered that eclipses could be predicted, and how the philosophers of Mesopotamia must have sought eagerly for evidence of fresh periodic laws. Certain of the stars, which appeared to wander, and were hence called planets, provided an extended field for these speculations. Among the Chaldaeans and Babylonians the knowledge gradually acquired was probably confined to the priests and utilised mainly for astrological prediction or the fixing of religious observances. Such speculations as were current among them, and also among the Egyptians and others who came to share their knowledge, were almost entirely devoted to mythology, assigning fanciful terrestrial origins to constellations, with occasional controversies as to how the earth is supported in space. The Greeks, too, had an elaborate mythology largely adapted from their neighbours, but they were not satisfied with this, and made persistent attempts to reduce the apparent motions of celestial objects to geometrical laws. Some of the Pythagoreans, if not Pythagoras himself, held that the earth is a sphere, and that the apparent daily revolution of the sun and stars is really due to a motion of the earth, though at first this motion of the earth was not supposed to be one of rotation about an axis. These notions, and also that the planets on the whole move round from west to east with reference to the stars, were made known to a larger circle through the writings of Plato. To Plato moreover is attributed the challenge to astronomers to represent all the motions of the heavenly bodies by uniformly described circles, a challenge generally held responsible for a vast amount of wasted effort, and the postponement, for many centuries, of real progress. Eudoxus of Cnidus, endeavouring to account for the fact that the planets, during every apparent revolution round the earth, come to rest twice, and in the shorter interval between these \"stationary points,\" move in the opposite direction, found that he could represent the phenomena fairly well by a system of concentric spheres, each rotating with its own velocity, and carrying its own particular planet round its own equator, the outermost sphere carrying the fixed stars. It was necessary to assume that the axes about which the various spheres revolved should have circular motions also, and gradually an increased number of spheres was evolved, the total number required by Aristotle reaching fifty-five. It may be regarded as counting in Aristotle's favour that he did consider the earth to be a sphere and not a flat disc, but he seems to have thought that the mathematical spheres of Eudoxus had a real solid existence, and that not only meteors, shooting stars and aurora, but also comets and the milky way belong to the atmosphere. His really great service to science in collating and criticising all that was known of natural science would have been greater if so much of the discussion had not been on the exact meaning of words used to describe phenomena, instead of on the facts and causes of the phenomena themselves.\nAristarchus of Samos seems to have been the first to suggest that the planets revolved not about the earth but about the sun, but the idea seemed so improbable that it was hardly noticed, especially as Aristarchus himself did not expand it into a treatise.\n\nAbout this time the necessity for more accurate places of the sun and moon, and the liberality of the Ptolemys who ruled Egypt, combined to provide regular observations at Alexandria, so that, when Hipparchus came upon the scene, there was a considerable amount of material for him to use. His discoveries marked a great advance in the science of astronomy. He noted the irregular motion of the sun, and, to explain it, assumed that it revolved uniformly not exactly about the earth but about a point some distance away, called the \"excentric\".[1] The line joining the centre of the earth to the excentric passes through the apses of the sun's orbit, where its distance from the earth is greatest and least. The same result he could obtain by assuming that the sun moved round a small circle, whose centre described a larger circle about the earth; this larger circle carrying the other was called the \"deferent\": so that the actual motion of the sun was in an epicycle. Of the two methods of expression Hipparchus ultimately preferred the second. He applied the same process to the moon but found that he could depend upon its being right only at new and full moon. The irregularity at first and third quarters he left to be investigated by his successors. He also considered the planetary observations at his disposal insufficient and so gave up the attempt at a complete planetary theory. He made improved determinations of some of the elements of the motions of the sun and moon, and discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes, from the Alexandrian observations which showed that each year as the sun came to cross the equator at the vernal equinox it did so at a point about fifty seconds of arc earlier on the ecliptic, thus producing in 150 years an unmistakable change of a couple of degrees, or four times the sun's diameter. He also invented trigonometry. His star catalogue was due to the appearance of a new star which caused him to search for possible previous similar phenomena, and also to prepare for checking future ones. No advance was made in theoretical astronomy for 260 years, the interval between Hipparchus and Ptolemy of Alexandria. Ptolemy accepted the spherical form of the earth but denied its rotation or any other movement. He made no advance on Hipparchus in regard to the sun, though the lapse of time had largely increased the errors of the elements adopted by the latter. In the case of the moon, however, Ptolemy traced the variable inequality noticed sometimes by Hipparchus at first and last quarter, which vanished when the moon was in apogee or perigee. This he called the evection, and introduced another epicycle to represent it. In his planetary theory he found that the places given by his adopted excentric did not fit, being one way at apogee and the other at perigee; so that the centre of distance must be nearer the earth. He found it best to assume the centre of distance half-way between the centre of the earth and the excentric, thus \"bisecting the excentricity\". Even this did not fit in the case of Mercury, and in general the agreement between theory and observation was spoilt by the necessity of making all the orbital planes pass through the centre of the earth, instead of the sun, thus making a good accordance practically impossible.\n\nAfter Ptolemy's time very little was heard for many centuries of any fresh planetary theory, though advances in some points of detail were made, notably by some of the Arab philosophers, who obtained improved values for some of the elements by using better instruments. From time to time various modifications of Ptolemy's theory were suggested, but none of any real value. The Moors in Spain did their share of the work carried on by their Eastern co-religionists, and the first independent star catalogue since the time of Hipparchus was made by another Oriental, Tamerlane's grandson, Ulugh Begh, who built a fine observatory at Samarcand in the fifteenth century. In Spain the work was not monopolised by the Moors, for in the thirteenth century Alphonso of Castile, with the assistance of Jewish and Christian computers, compiled the Alphonsine tables, completed in 1252, in which year he ascended the throne as Alphonso X. They were long circulated in MS. and were first printed in 1483, not long before the end of the period of stagnation.\n\nCopernicus was born in 1473 at Thorn in Polish Prussia. In the course of his studies at Cracow and at several Italian universities, he learnt all that was known of the Ptolemaic astronomy and determined to reform it. His maternal uncle, the Bishop of Ermland, having provided him with a lay canonry in the Cathedral of Frauenburg, he had leisure to devote himself to Science. Reviewing the suggestions of the ancient Greeks, he was struck by the simplification that would be introduced by reviving the idea that the annual motion should be attributed to the earth itself instead of having a separate annual epicycle for each planet and for the sun. Of the seventy odd circles or epicycles required by the latest form of the Ptolemaic system, Copernicus succeeded in dispensing with rather more than half, but he still required thirty-four, which was the exact number assumed before the time of Aristotle. His considerations were almost entirely mathematical, his only invasion into physics being in defence of the \"moving earth\" against the stock objection that if the earth moved, loose objects would fly off, and towers fall. He did not break sufficiently away from the old tradition of uniform circular motion. Ptolemy's efforts at exactness were baulked, as we have seen, by the supposed necessity of all the orbit planes passing through the earth, and if Copernicus had simply transferred this responsibility to the sun he would have done better. But he would not sacrifice the old fetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with respect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the centre of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun, thus handicapping himself in the same way though not in the same degree as Ptolemy. His thirty-four circles or epicycles comprised four for the earth, three for the moon, seven for Mercury (on account of his highly eccentric orbit) and five each for the other planets.\n\nIt is rather an exaggeration to call the present accepted system the Copernican system, as it is really due to Kepler, half a century after the death of Copernicus, but much credit is due to the latter for his successful attempt to provide a real alternative for the Ptolemaic system, instead of tinkering with it. The old geocentric system once shaken, the way was gradually smoothed for the heliocentric system, which Copernicus, still hampered by tradition, did not quite reach. He was hardly a practical astronomer in the observational sense. His first recorded observation, of an occultation of Aldebaran, was made in 1497, and he is not known to have made as many as fifty astronomical observations, while, of the few he did make and use, at least one was more than half a degree in error, which would have been intolerable to such an observer as Hipparchus. Copernicus in fact seems to have considered accurate observations unattainable with the instruments at hand. He refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the calendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not known with sufficient accuracy. It is possible that with better data he might have made much more progress. He was in no hurry to publish anything, perhaps on account of possible opposition. Certainly Luther, with his obstinate conviction of the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures, rejected as mere folly the idea of a moving earth, and Melanchthon thought such opinions should be prohibited, but Rheticus, a professor at the Protestant University of Wittenberg and an enthusiastic pupil of Copernicus, urged publication, and undertook to see the work through the press. This, however, he was unable to complete and another Lutheran, Osiander, to whom he entrusted it, wrote a preface, with the apparent intention of disarming opposition, in which he stated that the principles laid down were only abstract hypotheses convenient for purposes of calculation. This unauthorised interpolation may have had its share in postponing the prohibition of the book by the Church of Rome.\n\nAccording to Copernicus the earth is only a planet like the others, and not even the biggest one, while the sun is the most important body in the system, and the stars probably too far away for any motion of the earth to affect their apparent places. The earth in fact is very small in comparison with the distance of the stars, as evidenced by the fact that an observer anywhere on the earth appears to be in the middle of the universe. He shows that the revolution of the earth will account for the seasons, and for the stationary points and retrograde motions of the planets. He corrects definitely the order of the planets outwards from the sun, a matter which had been in dispute. A notable defect is due to the idea that a body can only revolve about another body or a point, as if rigidly connected with it, so that, in order to keep the earth's axis in a constant direction in space, he has to invent a third motion. His discussion of precession, which he rightly attributes to a slow motion of the earth's axis, is marred by the idea that the precession is variable. With all its defects, partly due to reliance on bad observations, the work showed a great advance in the interpretation of the motions of the planets; and his determinations of the periods both in relation to the earth and to the stars were adopted by Reinhold, Professor of Astronomy at Wittenberg, for the new Prutenic or Prussian Tables, which were to supersede the obsolete Alphonsine Tables of the thirteenth century.\n\nIn comparison with the question of the motion of the earth, no other astronomical detail of the time seems to be of much consequence. Comets, such as from time to time appeared, bright enough for naked eye observation, were still regarded as atmospheric phenomena, and their principal interest, as well as that of eclipses and planetary conjunctions, was in relation to astrology. Reform, however, was obviously in the air. The doctrine of Copernicus was destined very soon to divide others besides the Lutheran leaders. The leaven of inquiry was working, and not long after the death of Copernicus real advances were to come, first in the accuracy of observations, and, as a necessary result of these, in the planetary theory itself.",

Bryant's book \"Kepler\" sets the stage for the astronomical reforms introduced by Johannes Kepler by providing a comprehensive historical overview of the astronomical theories and practices that preceded him. The narrative begins in ancient times, highlighting humanity's early recognition of the celestial bodies' movements, such as the sun and moon, among the stars. It notes the significance of time divisions like days, months, and years, and the early ability to predict eclipses, especially among the Chaldaeans, who were highly respected for this knowledge.\n\nThe text then transitions to the contributions of various civilizations and individuals to the field of astronomy. The Babylonians and Egyptians, for instance, are mentioned for their astrological and mythological interpretations of celestial phenomena. The Greeks, however, are credited with attempting to understand these phenomena through geometrical laws. Notably, some Pythagoreans believed in a spherical Earth and its motion, a concept later expanded by Plato, who challenged astronomers to represent celestial motions using uniformly described circles—a challenge that significantly delayed progress in astronomy.\n\nEudoxus of Cnidus's theory of concentric spheres and Aristotle's adoption and expansion of this model are discussed next. Aristotle's belief in the solid reality of these spheres and his contributions to natural science, despite some limitations, are acknowledged. Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric theory is briefly mentioned as a significant but largely ignored advancement.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the Hellenistic period, focusing on Hipparchus's contributions, including his discovery of the precession of the equinoxes and the development of trigonometry. Ptolemy's work, particularly his advancements and limitations in understanding the moon's motion and planetary theory, is also detailed. The stagnation in astronomical theory following Ptolemy is noted, with brief mentions of contributions by Arab philosophers and the creation of the Alphonsine tables.\n\nThe chapter culminates with the revolutionary work of Copernicus, who challenged the geocentric model and proposed a heliocentric system. Despite not fully breaking away from the concept of uniform circular motion and retaining many epicycles, Copernicus's work is recognized for its significant step towards modern astronomy. The chapter notes the cautious reception of Copernicus's ideas, influenced by religious opposition, and the eventual publication of his work, which laid the groundwork for future advancements in astronomy.\n\nIn summary, this chapter provides a thorough historical background of astronomical theories leading up to Kepler's time, highlighting the gradual shift from mythological and geocentric models to a more scientific and heliocentric understanding of the cosmos. It sets the stage for Kepler's contributions by detailing the scientific context and challenges he inherited.",

                                    "text": "To introduce his reforms into astronomy, Kepler needed to overthrow several historical theories that had shaped the understanding of the cosmos for centuries. These theories included:\n\n1. **Geocentric models and the complexity of celestial motions**: The text mentions the early efforts by the Greeks, particularly the Pythagoreans, who attempted to explain celestial motions through geometrical laws but still adhered to Earth-centered (geocentric) models of the universe. This is evident from the challenge attributed to Plato, urging astronomers to represent all the motions of the heavenly bodies by uniformly described circles, which led to \"a vast amount of wasted effort, and the postponement, for many centuries, of real progress.\"\n\n2. **The system of concentric spheres**: Eudoxus of Cnidus developed a model of concentric spheres, each rotating with its own velocity to account for the complex motions of the planets. Aristotle expanded this model to include a total of fifty-five spheres. The text notes that Aristotle considered these mathematical spheres to have a real solid existence, which was a significant misconception Kepler had to address.\n\n3. **The Ptolemaic system**: The text outlines the contributions of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, who made significant advances in understanding celestial motions but still operated within a geocentric framework. Ptolemy's model, in particular, involved complex mechanisms like the \"excentric\" and \"epicycles\" to explain the irregular motions of celestial bodies. This system became the dominant cosmological model for over a millennium and represented a significant theoretical barrier that Kepler had to overcome.\n\n4. **The Copernican system**: While Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model, which was a step closer to Kepler's views, his model still relied on the concept of uniform circular motion and included a significant number of circles and epicycles (thirty-four, to be precise). The text highlights that Copernicus did not fully break away from the tradition of uniform circular motion, which was another aspect that Kepler needed to reform.\n\nIn summary, Kepler needed to overthrow the longstanding geocentric models, the complex system of concentric spheres, the Ptolemaic system with its epicycles and eccentrics, and even the partially correct Copernican system that still clung to the notion of uniform circular motion. These historical theories represented the major intellectual obstacles to the acceptance of Kepler's reforms, which ultimately laid the groundwork for modern astronomy.",

This system was designed to account for the observation that planets, during every apparent revolution around the Earth, come to rest twice and, in the shorter interval between these \"stationary points,\" move in the opposite direction. To represent these phenomena, it was necessary for Eudoxus to assume that the axes about which the various spheres revolved should have circular motions as well. Over time, this model evolved to include an increased number of spheres to accurately represent the observed celestial motions.\n\nAristotle's interpretation of these celestial spheres built upon the mathematical model proposed by Eudoxus. Aristotle seems to have believed that the mathematical spheres of Eudoxus had a real, solid existence. He considered the Earth to be a sphere and not a flat disc, which was a correct assumption. However, Aristotle extended the concept of celestial spheres to include not only the planets and stars but also other celestial phenomena such as meteors, shooting stars, aurora, comets, and the Milky Way, which he thought belonged to the atmosphere. Aristotle's significant contribution to science was in collating and criticizing all that was known of natural science at the time, although his work was somewhat limited by focusing too much on the semantics of the phenomena rather than on the facts and causes of the phenomena themselves.",

He noted the irregular motion of the sun and proposed two models to explain it: one involving the sun revolving uniformly not exactly about the earth but about a point some distance away, called the \"excentric\", and another model where the sun moved round a small circle, whose centre described a larger circle about the earth, known as the \"deferent\" with the actual motion of the sun being in an epicycle. Of these two methods, Hipparchus ultimately preferred the second. This approach was applied to the moon as well, although he found limitations in its accuracy, only being reliable at new and full moon. Despite these efforts, he left the irregularity observed at the first and third quarters of the moon's phases to be investigated by his successors. Additionally, Hipparchus made improved determinations of some of the elements of the motions of the sun and moon and discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes. He also invented trigonometry and compiled a star catalogue in response to the appearance of a new star, aiming to check for possible previous similar phenomena and prepare for future ones.\n\nHowever, Hipparchus's planetary theory had limitations. He considered the planetary observations at his disposal insufficient and thus gave up the attempt at a complete planetary theory. This indicates a significant limitation in his work, as he could not provide a comprehensive explanation for the motions of all the planets. Furthermore, his reliance on the epicycle and deferent models, while innovative, was based on the geocentric view of the universe, which would later be challenged and eventually overturned by the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus and refined by Kepler.\n\nIn summary, Hipparchus significantly advanced the science of astronomy through his observations and models explaining the irregular motion of celestial bodies, his discovery of the Precession of the Equinoxes, and the invention of trigonometry. However, his work had limitations, notably his inability to develop a complete planetary theory and his reliance on the geocentric model of the universe.",

This fundamental assumption limited the model's ability to accurately represent celestial motions.\n\n2. **Inaccuracies in the Sun's Motion**: While Ptolemy made no significant advance on Hipparchus in regard to the sun, the lapse of time had largely increased the errors of the elements adopted by the latter. This indicates that the model's representation of the sun's motion was not accurate.\n\n3. **Evection of the Moon**: In the case of the moon, Ptolemy identified the variable inequality noticed sometimes by Hipparchus at first and last quarter, which vanished when the moon was in apogee or perigee, and called this the evection. He introduced another epicycle to represent it, indicating a complexity that may not accurately reflect the moon's motion.\n\n4. **Planetary Theory Limitations**: Ptolemy found that the places given by his adopted eccentric did not fit, being one way at apogee and the other at perigee; so that the centre of distance must be nearer the earth. He found it best to assume the centre of distance half-way between the centre of the earth and the eccentric, thus \"bisecting the eccentricity\". Even this did not fit in the case of Mercury, and in general, the agreement between theory and observation was spoiled by the necessity of making all the orbital planes pass through the centre of the earth, instead of the sun, thus making a good accordance practically impossible.\n\nThese inaccuracies and limitations in Ptolemy's model contributed to a lack of precise representation of celestial motions, hindering the progress of astronomical understanding until the reforms introduced by later astronomers such as Copernicus and Kepler.",

However, it retained limitations such as the adherence to uniform circular motion and inaccurately placing planetary orbits, which stemmed from an inability to fully break away from traditional astronomical concepts.",

This connection to the respected ancient traditions provided a historical precedent that lent credibility to his proposals, making the heliocentric model more palatable to the scholarly community of the time.\n\n3. **Mathematical Considerations**: His considerations were \"almost entirely mathematical,\" focusing on the geometrical and mathematical aspects of celestial motions. This approach appealed to the scientific community's growing preference for empirical and mathematical explanations over purely philosophical or theological ones.\n\n4. **Challenging Geocentric Assumptions**: By proposing that the Earth is just another planet and not the center of the universe, Copernicus directly challenged the long-standing geocentric system. This bold assertion opened the door for further scientific inquiry and debate about the true nature of the cosmos, gradually leading to the acceptance of the heliocentric model.\n\n5. **Introduction of a Real Alternative**: Copernicus provided a \"real alternative for the Ptolemaic system, instead of tinkering with it.\" This alternative was not just a minor modification but a fundamentally different way of understanding the universe, which encouraged further exploration and refinement of the heliocentric concept.\n\nDespite these contributions, Copernicus's model was not without its flaws. For instance, he did not fully break away from the tradition of uniform circular motion and his planetary models still required a significant number of circles or epicycles. Moreover, his reluctance to fully place the sun at the center of all planetary orbits (instead of the Earth's orbit's center) limited the accuracy and elegance of his model. Nonetheless, his work marked a significant step forward in the development of astronomical theory, setting the stage for Kepler and others to refine and fully develop the heliocentric system.",

The text mentions that \"Copernicus in fact seems to have considered accurate observations unattainable with the instruments at hand. He refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the calendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not known with sufficient accuracy.\" This indicates a cautious approach by Copernicus, possibly due to the anticipated controversy his heliocentric model could provoke, especially among religious authorities who upheld the literal interpretation of the Scriptures.\n\nRheticus played a crucial role in the publication of Copernicus's work. He was described as \"an enthusiastic pupil of Copernicus\" and urged Copernicus to publish his findings. The text states, \"Certainly Luther, with his obstinate conviction of the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures, rejected as mere folly the idea of a moving earth, and Melanchthon thought such opinions should be prohibited, but Rheticus, a professor at the Protestant University of Wittenberg and an enthusiastic pupil of Copernicus, urged publication, and undertook to see the work through the press.\" However, Rheticus was unable to complete the task of overseeing the publication process.\n\nOsiander's role came into play when Rheticus entrusted him with the completion of the publication process. Osiander, aiming to mitigate potential opposition, wrote a preface to Copernicus's work without authorization. In this preface, he presented the heliocentric model as merely a hypothetical system that was convenient for calculations, rather than asserting its physical truth. The text elaborates, \"This, however, he was unable to complete and another Lutheran, Osiander, to whom he entrusted it, wrote a preface, with the apparent intention of disarming opposition, in which he stated that the principles laid down were only abstract hypotheses convenient for purposes of calculation.\" This strategy by Osiander may have played a part in delaying the Church of Rome's prohibition of the book, as it framed the heliocentric model in a less confrontational manner.",

This was a radical departure from the geocentric models that preceded it and represented a significant shift in the understanding of the universe. \"According to Copernicus the earth is only a planet like the others, and not even the biggest one, while the sun is the most important body in the system.\"\n\n3. **Order of the Planets**: Copernicus's model correctly identified the order of the planets from the sun, which had been a matter of dispute. \"He corrects definitely the order of the planets outwards from the sun, a matter which had been in dispute.\"\n\nHowever, Copernicus's model also had several defects, including:\n\n1. **Retention of Circular Orbits**: Despite the significant advancements, Copernicus's model still clung to the notion of uniform circular motion, which did not accurately reflect the elliptical orbits of planets. \"He did not break sufficiently away from the old tradition of uniform circular motion.\"\n\n2. **Incorrect Assumptions about Orbital Planes**: Copernicus made all planetary planes pass through the center of the earth's orbit instead of through the sun, which limited the accuracy of his model. \"But he would not sacrifice the old fetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with respect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the centre of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun.\"\n\n3. **Invention of a Third Motion**: To maintain the earth's axis in a constant direction in space, Copernicus had to invent a third motion, which was based on the flawed idea that a body can only revolve about another body or a point as if rigidly connected with it. \"In order to keep the earth's axis in a constant direction in space, he has to invent a third motion.\"\n\n4. **Variable Precession**: Copernicus's discussion of precession was marred by the incorrect idea that the precession is variable. \"His discussion of precession, which he rightly attributes to a slow motion of the earth's axis, is marred by the idea that the precession is variable.\"\n\nThese features and defects highlight the transformative yet imperfect nature of Copernicus's model in the progression of astronomical theory.",

The enduring association of these phenomena with astrology, despite the progress in astronomical theory, underscores the slow pace of change in scientific paradigms and the strong influence of historical and cultural contexts on the interpretation of natural phenomena.",

                    "text": "In order to emphasise the importance of the reforms introduced into astronomy by Kepler, it will be well to sketch briefly the history of the theories which he had to overthrow. In very early times it must have been realised that the sun and moon were continually changing their places among the stars. The day, the month, and the year were obvious divisions of time, and longer periods were suggested by the tabulation of eclipses. We can imagine the respect accorded to the Chaldaean sages who first discovered that eclipses could be predicted, and how the philosophers of Mesopotamia must have sought eagerly for evidence of fresh periodic laws. Certain of the stars, which appeared to wander, and were hence called planets, provided an extended field for these speculations. Among the Chaldaeans and Babylonians the knowledge gradually acquired was probably confined to the priests and utilised mainly for astrological prediction or the fixing of religious observances. Such speculations as were current among them, and also among the Egyptians and others who came to share their knowledge, were almost entirely devoted to mythology, assigning fanciful terrestrial origins to constellations, with occasional controversies as to how the earth is supported in space. The Greeks, too, had an elaborate mythology largely adapted from their neighbours, but they were not satisfied with this, and made persistent attempts to reduce the apparent motions of celestial objects to geometrical laws. Some of the Pythagoreans, if not Pythagoras himself, held that the earth is a sphere, and that the apparent daily revolution of the sun and stars is really due to a motion of the earth, though at first this motion of the earth was not supposed to be one of rotation about an axis. These notions, and also that the planets on the whole move round from west to east with reference to the stars, were made known to a larger circle through the writings of Plato. To Plato moreover is attributed the challenge to astronomers to represent all the motions of the heavenly bodies by uniformly described circles, a challenge generally held responsible for a vast amount of wasted effort, and the postponement, for many centuries, of real progress. Eudoxus of Cnidus, endeavouring to account for the fact that the planets, during every apparent revolution round the earth, come to rest twice, and in the shorter interval between these \"stationary points,\" move in the opposite direction, found that he could represent the phenomena fairly well by a system of concentric spheres, each rotating with its own velocity, and carrying its own particular planet round its own equator, the outermost sphere carrying the fixed stars. It was necessary to assume that the axes about which the various spheres revolved should have circular motions also, and gradually an increased number of spheres was evolved, the total number required by Aristotle reaching fifty-five. It may be regarded as counting in Aristotle's favour that he did consider the earth to be a sphere and not a flat disc, but he seems to have thought that the mathematical spheres of Eudoxus had a real solid existence, and that not only meteors, shooting stars and aurora, but also comets and the milky way belong to the atmosphere. His really great service to science in collating and criticising all that was known of natural science would have been greater if so much of the discussion had not been on the exact meaning of words used to describe phenomena, instead of on the facts and causes of the phenomena themselves.\nAristarchus of Samos seems to have been the first to suggest that the planets revolved not about the earth but about the sun, but the idea seemed so improbable that it was hardly noticed, especially as Aristarchus himself did not expand it into a treatise.",

It highlights the early understanding of celestial movements by ancient civilizations like the Chaldaeans, Babylonians, and Greeks. The text mentions the Chaldaean sages' discovery of predicting eclipses, the Greek attempts to explain celestial motions through geometrical laws, and the challenge posed by Plato to represent celestial motions with uniformly described circles. It also touches upon Eudoxus of Cnidus's model of concentric spheres to explain planetary motions, Aristotle's belief in multiple rotating spheres, and Aristarchus of Samos's idea that planets revolve around the sun. The paragraph emphasizes the prevalent mythological interpretations of celestial phenomena and the gradual shift towards scientific inquiry in ancient astronomy.",

His discoveries marked a great advance in the science of astronomy. He noted the irregular motion of the sun, and, to explain it, assumed that it revolved uniformly not exactly about the earth but about a point some distance away, called the \"excentric\".[1] The line joining the centre of the earth to the excentric passes through the apses of the sun's orbit, where its distance from the earth is greatest and least. The same result he could obtain by assuming that the sun moved round a small circle, whose centre described a larger circle about the earth; this larger circle carrying the other was called the \"deferent\": so that the actual motion of the sun was in an epicycle. Of the two methods of expression Hipparchus ultimately preferred the second. He applied the same process to the moon but found that he could depend upon its being right only at new and full moon. The irregularity at first and third quarters he left to be investigated by his successors. He also considered the planetary observations at his disposal insufficient and so gave up the attempt at a complete planetary theory. He made improved determinations of some of the elements of the motions of the sun and moon, and discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes, from the Alexandrian observations which showed that each year as the sun came to cross the equator at the vernal equinox it did so at a point about fifty seconds of arc earlier on the ecliptic, thus producing in 150 years an unmistakable change of a couple of degrees, or four times the sun's diameter. He also invented trigonometry. His star catalogue was due to the appearance of a new star which caused him to search for possible previous similar phenomena, and also to prepare for checking future ones. No advance was made in theoretical astronomy for 260 years, the interval between Hipparchus and Ptolemy of Alexandria. Ptolemy accepted the spherical form of the earth but denied its rotation or any other movement. He made no advance on Hipparchus in regard to the sun, though the lapse of time had largely increased the errors of the elements adopted by the latter. In the case of the moon, however, Ptolemy traced the variable inequality noticed sometimes by Hipparchus at first and last quarter, which vanished when the moon was in apogee or perigee. This he called the evection, and introduced another epicycle to represent it. In his planetary theory he found that the places given by his adopted excentric did not fit, being one way at apogee and the other at perigee; so that the centre of distance must be nearer the earth. He found it best to assume the centre of distance half-way between the centre of the earth and the excentric, thus \"bisecting the excentricity\". Even this did not fit in the case of Mercury, and in general the agreement between theory and observation was spoilt by the necessity of making all the orbital planes pass through the centre of the earth, instead of the sun, thus making a good accordance practically impossible.",

From time to time various modifications of Ptolemy's theory were suggested, but none of any real value. The Moors in Spain did their share of the work carried on by their Eastern co-religionists, and the first independent star catalogue since the time of Hipparchus was made by another Oriental, Tamerlane's grandson, Ulugh Begh, who built a fine observatory at Samarcand in the fifteenth century. In Spain the work was not monopolised by the Moors, for in the thirteenth century Alphonso of Castile, with the assistance of Jewish and Christian computers, compiled the Alphonsine tables, completed in 1252, in which year he ascended the throne as Alphonso X. They were long circulated in MS. and were first printed in 1483, not long before the end of the period of stagnation.",

Despite minor improvements by Arab philosophers in refining certain elements using better instruments, there was a prolonged period of stagnation in the development of new planetary theories. While some modifications to Ptolemy's theory were proposed over the centuries, none were deemed substantial. The text highlights the contributions of Arab philosophers, particularly in obtaining more accurate astronomical values. Additionally, it mentions Ulugh Begh, Tamerlane's grandson, who constructed an observatory in Samarcand and created a notable star catalogue in the fifteenth century. The paragraph also touches on Alphonso of Castile's collaboration with Jewish and Christian scholars to compile the Alphonsine tables in the thirteenth century, marking a significant astronomical achievement before the end of the stagnant period.",

In the course of his studies at Cracow and at several Italian universities, he learnt all that was known of the Ptolemaic astronomy and determined to reform it. His maternal uncle, the Bishop of Ermland, having provided him with a lay canonry in the Cathedral of Frauenburg, he had leisure to devote himself to Science. Reviewing the suggestions of the ancient Greeks, he was struck by the simplification that would be introduced by reviving the idea that the annual motion should be attributed to the earth itself instead of having a separate annual epicycle for each planet and for the sun. Of the seventy odd circles or epicycles required by the latest form of the Ptolemaic system, Copernicus succeeded in dispensing with rather more than half, but he still required thirty-four, which was the exact number assumed before the time of Aristotle. His considerations were almost entirely mathematical, his only invasion into physics being in defence of the \"moving earth\" against the stock objection that if the earth moved, loose objects would fly off, and towers fall. He did not break sufficiently away from the old tradition of uniform circular motion. Ptolemy's efforts at exactness were baulked, as we have seen, by the supposed necessity of all the orbit planes passing through the earth, and if Copernicus had simply transferred this responsibility to the sun he would have done better. But he would not sacrifice the old fetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with respect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the centre of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun, thus handicapping himself in the same way though not in the same degree as Ptolemy. His thirty-four circles or epicycles comprised four for the earth, three for the moon, seven for Mercury (on account of his highly eccentric orbit) and five each for the other planets.",

Furthermore, it is noted that Copernicus maintained a connection to the old tradition by making all planetary planes pass through the center of the earth's orbit instead of through the sun, similar to Ptolemy's approach. This decision hindered Copernicus in fully embracing a new model, as it states, \"But he would not sacrifice the old fetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with respect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the center of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun, thus handicapping himself in the same way though not in the same degree as Ptolemy.\"",

Firstly, Copernicus proposed attributing the annual motion to the earth itself, simplifying the complex system of epicycles in the Ptolemaic model. He aimed to reduce the number of circles or epicycles required, succeeding in dispensing with more than half of them. This was a significant departure from the Ptolemaic system, which relied on numerous epicycles to explain planetary motion. Copernicus still required thirty-four circles, but this was a considerable reduction compared to the Ptolemaic system. Secondly, Copernicus focused primarily on mathematical considerations rather than delving deeply into physics, defending the concept of a \"moving earth\" against objections related to objects flying off or towers falling. This emphasis on mathematical analysis marked a shift in the approach to understanding celestial motion. Lastly, while Copernicus did not completely break away from the tradition of uniform circular motion, his reform introduced a new way of conceptualizing planetary orbits by making all planetary planes pass through the center of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun. This decision, although not entirely breaking free from the old paradigm, represented a significant departure from Ptolemy's approach.",

The old geocentric system once shaken, the way was gradually smoothed for the heliocentric system, which Copernicus, still hampered by tradition, did not quite reach. He was hardly a practical astronomer in the observational sense. His first recorded observation, of an occultation of Aldebaran, was made in 1497, and he is not known to have made as many as fifty astronomical observations, while, of the few he did make and use, at least one was more than half a degree in error, which would have been intolerable to such an observer as Hipparchus. Copernicus in fact seems to have considered accurate observations unattainable with the instruments at hand. He refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the calendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not known with sufficient accuracy. It is possible that with better data he might have made much more progress. He was in no hurry to publish anything, perhaps on account of possible opposition. Certainly Luther, with his obstinate conviction of the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures, rejected as mere folly the idea of a moving earth, and Melanchthon thought such opinions should be prohibited, but Rheticus, a professor at the Protestant University of Wittenberg and an enthusiastic pupil of Copernicus, urged publication, and undertook to see the work through the press. This, however, he was unable to complete and another Lutheran, Osiander, to whom he entrusted it, wrote a preface, with the apparent intention of disarming opposition, in which he stated that the principles laid down were only abstract hypotheses convenient for purposes of calculation. This unauthorised interpolation may have had its share in postponing the prohibition of the book by the Church of Rome.",

He simplified the complex system of epicycles and circles used in the geocentric model, although he still retained some of these elements due to traditional beliefs. Copernicus proposed that the annual motion should be attributed to the Earth itself moving around the Sun, which was a significant departure from the geocentric model. Despite not completely breaking away from the old tradition of uniform circular motion and facing challenges in accurately predicting celestial motions, Copernicus laid the groundwork for the heliocentric system. His work paved the way for further advancements in astronomy, leading to the heliocentric model eventually being refined and expanded upon by later astronomers like Kepler.\n\nIn the text, it is mentioned that \"Copernicus succeeded in dispensing with rather more than half\" of the circles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic system, and that \"the way was gradually smoothed for the heliocentric system, which Copernicus, still hampered by tradition, did not quite reach.\" This indicates that Copernicus made significant strides towards the heliocentric model by simplifying the existing system.",

Copernicus himself seemed to believe that accurate observations were unattainable with the instruments of his time, as he \"refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the calendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not known with sufficient accuracy.\"\n\nThis impacted Copernicus's work by potentially hindering the precision and reliability of the data he used in developing his heliocentric model. The lack of accurate observational data may have influenced his cautious approach to publishing his work, as he was \"in no hurry to publish anything, perhaps on account of possible opposition.\" Additionally, the text suggests that Copernicus's reluctance to publish could have been influenced by the opposition he might face, such as from figures like Luther who rejected the idea of a moving earth. The challenges in making accurate observations likely contributed to the slow progress and reception of Copernicus's heliocentric theory, as he grappled with the limitations of observational data available to him.",

The Greeks, for example, made persistent attempts to reduce the apparent motions of celestial objects to geometrical laws, with some Pythagoreans even proposing that the earth is a sphere and that the planets move round from west to east with reference to the stars. Plato challenged astronomers to represent all celestial motions by uniformly described circles, which led to significant efforts but also some wasted time. Eudoxus of Cnidus developed a system of concentric spheres to explain planetary motions, and Aristotle further expanded this model with a total of fifty-five spheres. \n\nThe Chaldaeans and Babylonians, on the other hand, focused on predicting eclipses and developing periodic laws, mainly for astrological prediction or religious purposes. They assigned mythological origins to constellations and engaged in speculations about how the earth is supported in space. Aristarchus of Samos was the first to suggest that planets revolved around the sun instead of the earth, but his idea was not widely accepted at the time. \n\nOverall, these early civilizations contributed to the gradual evolution of astronomical thought, setting the stage for later astronomers like Copernicus to challenge existing geocentric models and pave the way for the heliocentric system.",

The earth in fact is very small in comparison with the distance of the stars, as evidenced by the fact that an observer anywhere on the earth appears to be in the middle of the universe. He shows that the revolution of the earth will account for the seasons, and for the stationary points and retrograde motions of the planets. He corrects definitely the order of the planets outwards from the sun, a matter which had been in dispute. A notable defect is due to the idea that a body can only revolve about another body or a point, as if rigidly connected with it, so that, in order to keep the earth's axis in a constant direction in space, he has to invent a third motion. His discussion of precession, which he rightly attributes to a slow motion of the earth's axis, is marred by the idea that the precession is variable. With all its defects, partly due to reliance on bad observations, the work showed a great advance in the interpretation of the motions of the planets; and his determinations of the periods both in relation to the earth and to the stars were adopted by Reinhold, Professor of Astronomy at Wittenberg, for the new Prutenic or Prussian Tables, which were to supersede the obsolete Alphonsine Tables of the thirteenth century.",

            "text": "On 21st December, 1571, at Weil in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, was born a weak and sickly seven-months' child, to whom his parents Henry and Catherine Kepler gave the name of John. Henry Kepler was a petty officer in the service of the reigning Duke, and in 1576 joined the army serving in the Netherlands. His wife followed him, leaving her young son in his grandfather's care at Leonberg, where he barely recovered from a severe attack of smallpox. It was from this place that John derived the Latinised name of Leonmontanus, in accordance with the common practice of the time, but he was not known by it to any great extent. He was sent to school in 1577, but in the following year his father returned to Germany, almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he had become surety. Henry Kepler was obliged to sell his house and most of his belongings, and to keep a tavern at Elmendingen, withdrawing his son from school to help him with the rough work. In 1583 young Kepler was sent to the school at Elmendingen, and in 1584 had another narrow escape from death by a violent illness. In 1586 he was sent, at the charges of the Duke, to the monastic school of Maulbronn; from whence, in accordance with the school regulations, he passed at the end of his first year the examination for the bachelor's degree at Tübingen, returning for two more years as a \"veteran\" to Maulbronn before being admitted as a resident student at Tübingen. The three years thus spent at Maulbronn were marked by recurrences of several of the diseases from which he had suffered in childhood, and also by family troubles at his home. His father went away after a quarrel with his wife Catherine, and died abroad. Catherine herself, who seems to have been of a very unamiable disposition, next quarrelled with her own relatives. It is not surprising therefore that Kepler after taking his M.A. degree in August, 1591, coming out second in the examination lists, was ready to accept the first appointment offered him, even if it should involve leaving home. This happened to be the lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, the chief town in Styria. Kepler's knowledge of astronomy was limited to the compulsory school course, nor had he as yet any particular leaning towards the science; the post, moreover, was a meagre and unimportant one. On the other hand he had frequently expressed disgust at the way in which one after another of his companions had refused \"foreign\" appointments which had been arranged for them under the Duke's scheme of education. His tutors also strongly urged him to accept the lectureship, and he had not the usual reluctance to leave home. He therefore proceeded to Gratz, protesting that he did not thereby forfeit his claim to a more promising opening, when such should appear. His astronomical tutor, Maestlin, encouraged him to devote himself to his newly adopted science, and the first result of this advice appeared before very long in Kepler's \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\". The bent of his mind was towards philosophical speculation, to which he had been attracted in his youthful studies of Scaliger's \"Exoteric Exercises\". He says he devoted much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of fountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents and inland seas, and things of this sort\". Following his tutor in his admiration for the Copernican theory, he wrote an essay on the primary motion, attributing it to the rotation of the earth, and this not for the mathematical reasons brought forward by Copernicus, but, as he himself says, on physical or metaphysical grounds. In 1595, having more leisure from lectures, he turned his speculative mind to the number, size, and motion of the planetary orbits. He first tried simple numerical relations, but none of them appeared to be twice, thrice, or four times as great as another, although he felt convinced that there was some relation between the motions and the distances, seeing that when a gap appeared in one series, there was a corresponding gap in the other. These gaps he attempted to fill by hypothetical planets between Mars and Jupiter, and between Mercury and Venus, but this method also failed to provide the regular proportion which he sought, besides being open to the objection that on the same principle there might be many more equally invisible planets at either end of the series. He was nevertheless unwilling to adopt the opinion of Rheticus that the number six was sacred, maintaining that the \"sacredness\" of the number was of much more recent date than the creation of the worlds, and could not therefore account for it. He next tried an ingenious idea, comparing the perpendiculars from different points of a quadrant of a circle on a tangent at its extremity. The greatest of these, the tangent, not being cut by the quadrant, he called the line of the sun, and associated with infinite force. The shortest, being the point at the other end of the quadrant, thus corresponded to the fixed stars or zero force; intermediate ones were to be found proportional to the \"forces\" of the six planets. After a great amount of unfinished trial calculations, which took nearly a whole summer, he convinced himself that success did not lie that way. In July, 1595, while lecturing on the great planetary conjunctions, he drew quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac showing the slow progression of these points of conjunction at intervals of just over 240° or eight signs. The successive chords marked out a smaller circle to which they were tangents, about half the diameter of the zodiacal circle as drawn, and Kepler at once saw a similarity to the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter, the radius of the inscribed circle of an equilateral triangle being half that of the circumscribed circle. His natural sequence of ideas impelled him to try a square, in the hope that the circumscribed and inscribed circles might give him a similar \"analogy\" for the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. He next tried a pentagon and so on, but he soon noted that he would never reach the sun that way, nor would he find any such limitation as six, the number of \"possibles\" being obviously infinite. The actual planets moreover were not even six but only five, so far as he knew, so he next pondered the question of what sort of things these could be of which only five different figures were possible and suddenly thought of the five regular solids.[2] He immediately pounced upon this idea and ultimately evolved the following scheme. \"The earth is the sphere, the measure of all; round it describe a dodecahedron; the sphere including this will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; the sphere including this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere including this will be Saturn. Now, inscribe in the earth an icosahedron, the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus: inscribe an octahedron in Venus: the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury.\" With this result Kepler was inordinately pleased, and regretted not a moment of the time spent in obtaining it, though to us this \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" can only appear useless, even without the more recent additions to the known planets. He admitted that a certain thickness must be assigned to the intervening spheres to cover the greatest and least distances of the several planets from the sun, but even then some of the numbers obtained are not a very close fit for the corresponding planetary orbits. Kepler's own suggested explanation of the discordances was that they must be due to erroneous measures of the planetary distances, and this, in those days of crude and infrequent observations, could not easily be disproved. He next thought of a variety of reasons why the five regular solids should occur in precisely the order given and in no other, diverging from this into a subtle and not very intelligible process of reasoning to account for the division of the zodiac into 360°. The next subject was more important, and dealt with the relation between the distances of the planets and their times of revolution round the sun. It was obvious that the period was not simply proportional to the distance, as the outer planets were all too slow for this, and he concluded \"either that the moving intelligences of the planets are weakest in those that are farthest from the sun, or that there is one moving intelligence in the sun, the common centre, forcing them all round, but those most violently which are nearest, and that it languishes in some sort and grows weaker at the most distant, because of the remoteness and the attenuation of the virtue\". This is not so near a guess at the theory of gravitation as might be supposed, for Kepler imagined that a repulsive force was necessary to account for the planets being sometimes further from the sun, and so laid aside the idea of a constant attractive force. He made several other attempts to find a law connecting the distances and periods of the planets, but without success at that time, and only desisted when by unconsciously arguing in a circle he appeared to get the same result from two totally different hypotheses. He sent copies of his book to several leading astronomers, of whom Galileo praised his ingenuity and good faith, while Tycho Brahe was evidently much struck with the work and advised him to adapt something similar to the Tychonic system instead of the Copernican. He also intimated that his Uraniborg observations would provide more accurate determinations of the planetary orbits, and thus made Kepler eager to visit him, a project which as we shall see was more than fulfilled. Another copy of the book Kepler sent to Reymers the Imperial astronomer with a most fulsome letter, which Tycho, who asserted that Reymers had simply plagiarised his work, very strongly resented, thus drawing from Kepler a long letter of apology. About the same time Kepler had married a lady already twice widowed, and become involved in difficulties with her relatives on financial grounds, and with the Styrian authorities in connection with the religious disputes then coming to a head. On account of these latter he thought it expedient, the year after his marriage, to withdraw to Hungary, from whence he sent short treatises to Tübingen, \"On the magnet\" (following the ideas of Gilbert of Colchester), \"On the cause of the obliquity of the ecliptic\" and \"On the Divine wisdom as shown in the Creation\". His next important step makes it desirable to devote a chapter to a short notice of Tycho Brahe.\n\n[Footnote 2: Since the sum of the plane angles at a corner of a regular solid must be less than four right angles, it is easily seen that few regular solids are possible. Hexagonal faces are clearly impossible, or any polygonal faces with more than five sides. The possible forms are the dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces, three meeting at each corner; the cube, six square faces, three meeting at each corner; and three figures with triangular faces, the tetrahedron of four faces, three meeting at each corner; the octahedron of eight faces, four meeting at each corner; and the icosahedron of twenty faces, five meeting at each corner.]",

His father, Henry Kepler, a petty officer, and his mother, Catherine, left young Kepler under his grandfather's care, which marked the beginning of a tumultuous childhood marked by illness and family strife.\n\nDespite these hardships, Kepler's intellectual promise earned him a place at the monastic school of Maulbronn through the support of the Duke, followed by his admission to the University of Tübingen. It was here that Kepler, initially without a strong inclination towards astronomy, began his academic and philosophical exploration under the guidance of his tutor Maestlin. This period was crucial for Kepler's development, as he delved into philosophical speculation and the Copernican theory of the universe, which posited that the Earth and planets orbit the sun.\n\nKepler's move to Gratz to take up a lectureship in astronomy marked the beginning of his significant contributions to the field. Despite his initial limited knowledge, Kepler's speculative mind led him to profound inquiries into the nature of the cosmos, culminating in his work \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\". In this work, Kepler proposed a model of the solar system using the five Platonic solids to explain the distances between the planets and the sun, a theory that, while flawed, showcased his innovative approach to understanding the universe.\n\nKepler's relentless pursuit of knowledge and understanding also led him to explore the relationship between the distances of planets from the sun and their orbital periods. This exploration, although not immediately fruitful, laid the groundwork for his later discovery of the laws of planetary motion that bear his name. His correspondence with contemporary astronomers like Galileo and Tycho Brahe, and his personal challenges, including marital and financial difficulties, as well as religious disputes, are also highlighted, underscoring the complex interplay of personal and professional life in Kepler's journey.\n\nThe chapter concludes with a transition to Kepler's interaction with Tycho Brahe, setting the stage for further developments in Kepler's astronomical work. Through Bryant's detailed narrative, we gain insight into the early life of Johannes Kepler, whose blend of philosophical speculation and empirical investigation led to groundbreaking advancements in astronomy, fundamentally altering our understanding of the universe.",

Born on December 21, 1571, in Weil in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, Kepler was a \"weak and sickly seven-months' child.\" His health struggles continued into his childhood, as he \"barely recovered from a severe attack of smallpox\" while under his grandfather's care in Leonberg after his parents left for the Netherlands due to his father's military service.\n\nThe family's financial situation was precarious. Kepler's father, Henry Kepler, returned to Germany \"almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he had become surety.\" This financial hardship forced the family to sell their house and most of their belongings, and Henry Kepler had to keep a tavern at Elmendingen. As a result, young Kepler was withdrawn from school to assist with the tavern's rough work.\n\nDespite these early setbacks, Kepler's education resumed and progressed through various institutions. In 1583, he was sent to the school at Elmendingen, and despite another \"narrow escape from death by a violent illness\" in 1584, his academic journey continued. By 1586, he was sent to the monastic school of Maulbronn, thanks to the support of the Duke. His time at Maulbronn was not without difficulty, as it was \"marked by recurrences of several of the diseases from which he had suffered in childhood, and also by family troubles at his home.\" His father left after a quarrel and later died abroad, and his mother had disputes with her own relatives.\n\nKepler's educational path led him to Tübingen, where he pursued higher education, eventually taking his M.A. degree in August 1591 and coming out second in the examination lists. Despite his limited initial interest in astronomy, the first appointment offered to him was a lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, which he accepted, marking the beginning of his significant contributions to the field.\n\nIn summary, John Kepler's early life was fraught with health challenges, family instability, and financial hardship, yet he managed to pursue an education that set the stage for his future achievements in astronomy and science.",

Initially, Kepler's father, Henry Kepler, was a petty officer in the service of the reigning Duke, which suggests a modest but stable position. However, the family's financial stability began to deteriorate when Henry Kepler joined the army serving in the Netherlands in 1576 and subsequently almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he had become surety. This financial misfortune forced Henry Kepler to sell his house and most of his belongings, and to keep a tavern at Elmendingen. As a direct consequence of these financial difficulties, young Kepler was withdrawn from school to help with the rough work at the tavern.\n\nDespite these challenges, Kepler's educational journey continued when, in 1583, he was sent to the school at Elmendingen, and later, his prospects significantly improved due to the intervention of external support. In 1586, Kepler was sent, at the charges of the Duke, to the monastic school of Maulbronn. This opportunity was pivotal as it allowed Kepler to continue his education at a higher level, eventually leading him to Tübingen where he pursued further studies and earned his M.A. degree. The support from the Duke indicates that despite the family's financial struggles and the father's career downturn, Kepler was able to access educational opportunities that were not directly funded by his family's resources.\n\nFurthermore, the financial and familial instability, including the departure and eventual death of his father after a quarrel, and disputes involving his mother, may have influenced Kepler's readiness to accept the first appointment offered to him after completing his M.A. degree. This appointment was the lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, which Kepler accepted despite his limited knowledge of astronomy at the time and no particular leaning towards the science. This decision to accept the lectureship can be seen as a direct consequence of his desire to find stable employment and possibly to distance himself from his family's troubles.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's early education and opportunities were significantly affected by his family's financial situation and his father's career. Financial hardships led to interruptions in his education and contributed to his early responsibilities within the family. However, the support from the Duke allowed him to pursue his education further, and the instability at home may have influenced his decision to accept an appointment that set him on the path to his future contributions to astronomy.",

Initially, his readiness to accept the first appointment offered to him, even if it involved leaving home, was due to his personal circumstances and the state of his career after completing his M.A. degree. The text mentions, \"Kepler after taking his M.A. degree in August, 1591, coming out second in the examination lists, was ready to accept the first appointment offered him, even if it should involve leaving home.\" This readiness was further supported by his previous expressions of disgust at how his companions had refused \"foreign\" appointments arranged for them under the Duke's scheme of education. Additionally, his tutors strongly urged him to accept the lectureship, and he did not have the usual reluctance to leave home, which made the decision easier for him.\n\nKepler's interest in astronomy developed gradually and was not his initial field of interest. Upon accepting the lectureship, his knowledge of astronomy was limited to the compulsory school course, and he had no particular leaning towards the science at that time. The text states, \"Kepler's knowledge of astronomy was limited to the compulsory school course, nor had he as yet any particular leaning towards the science.\" However, his astronomical tutor, Maestlin, encouraged him to devote himself to his newly adopted science. This encouragement led to Kepler's first significant work in astronomy, the \"Mysterium Cosmographicum.\" His philosophical inclinations also played a role in his growing interest in astronomy. The text describes how Kepler was attracted to philosophical speculation from his youthful studies and how he devoted much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of fountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents and inland seas, and things of this sort.\" This philosophical bent of mind, combined with his admiration for the Copernican theory, which he followed due to his tutor's influence, led him to explore astronomical concepts more deeply, ultimately contributing to his development as an astronomer.",

This wide-ranging curiosity set the stage for his later specific inquiries into the cosmos.\n\nKepler's speculative journey towards the 'Mysterium Cosmographicum' began with his attempts to understand the planetary orbits through \"simple numerical relations,\" though he found no satisfactory proportional relationships between them. His refusal to accept the sacredness of the number six as an explanation for the number of planets shows his desire for a more rational, structural understanding of the universe.\n\nThe turning point in his speculative journey came in July 1595, during a lecture on great planetary conjunctions. The visualization of quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac led him to draw parallels between the geometrical arrangements and the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter. This insight propelled him to explore geometric shapes further, eventually leading him to ponder on \"what sort of things these could be of which only five different figures were possible\" and suddenly thinking of the five regular solids.\n\nThis moment of insight was crucial, as Kepler immediately seized upon the idea of the five regular solids and developed a comprehensive model of the cosmos based on them. He envisioned the planets' orbits as being determined by the spheres that could be inscribed and circumscribed around these solids, arranging them in a specific order that reflected their distances from the sun. This model, despite its speculative nature and the later realization that it did not perfectly fit the known planetary orbits, represented a significant attempt to find a harmonious and geometrically ordered structure in the universe.\n\nKepler's speculative approach, characterized by a blend of philosophical inquiry, mathematical experimentation, and a moment of geometric insight, directly led to the development of his 'Mysterium Cosmographicum'. His willingness to explore and combine different fields of thought, even in the face of initial failures and the speculative nature of his inquiries, was instrumental in the creation of this early model of the cosmos.",

Kepler's speculative mind led him to ponder the question of what sort of geometric figures could exist in such a way that only five different figures were possible, which led him to think of the five regular solids. He then devised a scheme where these solids were placed between the orbits of the known planets to explain their distances from each other. The model is described as follows: \"The earth is the sphere, the measure of all; round it describe a dodecahedron; the sphere including this will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; the sphere including this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere including this will be Saturn. Now, inscribe in the earth an icosahedron, the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus: inscribe an octahedron in Venus: the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury.\" Kepler was \"inordinately pleased\" with this result and did not regret the time spent in obtaining it, despite acknowledging that a certain thickness must be assigned to the intervening spheres to cover the greatest and least distances of the several planets from the sun, and even then, some of the numbers obtained were not a very close fit for the corresponding planetary orbits.

This situation led to Kepler writing a long letter of apology to Tycho, as indicated by, \"Another copy of the book Kepler sent to Reymers the Imperial astronomer with a most fulsome letter, which Tycho, who asserted that Reymers had simply plagiarised his work, very strongly resented, thus drawing from Kepler a long letter of apology.\"\n\nThese challenges highlight the complex interplay of personal relationships, professional aspirations, and the broader socio-political context in which Kepler operated following the publication of his 'Mysterium Cosmographicum'.",

The text outlines how Kepler's speculative mind and philosophical inclinations led him to develop the \"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" a work that attempted to explain the cosmos through geometric models. His dedication to this work and the innovative ideas it contained caught the attention of contemporary astronomers, including Tycho Brahe.\n\nTycho Brahe, who was evidently much struck with the work, advised Kepler to adapt something similar to the Tychonic system instead of the Copernican. This advice from Brahe indicates that Kepler's work was not only recognized for its ingenuity but also seen as potentially compatible with or adaptable to other prevailing astronomical models of the time. Brahe's suggestion to Kepler to consider the Tychonic system over the Copernican system demonstrates the influence of Kepler's work on his contemporaries and how it opened up avenues for further exploration and collaboration.\n\nMoreover, Tycho Brahe intimated that his Uraniborg observations would provide more accurate determinations of the planetary orbits, thus making Kepler eager to visit him. This interaction highlights how \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" facilitated a connection between Kepler and Brahe, leading to Kepler's eagerness to work with Brahe to refine his theories further. The text suggests that Brahe's observations and data were seen as a valuable resource by Kepler, who was always in search of more accurate and empirical evidence to support or refine his hypotheses.\n\nThe collaboration between Kepler and Tycho Brahe, as hinted at in the text, was a significant turning point in Kepler's scientific career. Brahe's observations and data provided Kepler with the empirical evidence he needed to develop his laws of planetary motion, which would eventually revolutionize astronomy. Thus, the \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" not only showcased Kepler's innovative thinking but also served as a catalyst for his later groundbreaking work in astronomy, facilitated by his collaboration with Tycho Brahe.",

Philosophically, Kepler was driven by a quest for a harmonious cosmic order, which is evident in his speculative approach to understanding the universe. He was attracted to philosophical speculation from his youthful studies, as he devoted much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of fountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents and inland seas, and things of this sort.\" This inclination towards seeking a deeper, metaphysical understanding of the cosmos guided his scientific inquiries.\n\nMathematically, Kepler's approach was characterized by his attempts to apply geometric and numerical relationships to the cosmos. His first significant attempt involved trying \"simple numerical relations\" between the planetary orbits, although he found that none of the relations appeared to be directly proportional (e.g., twice, thrice, or four times as great as another). He then explored the idea of filling the gaps in the planetary series with hypothetical planets, which also did not yield the regular proportion he sought. This failure led him to reject the notion that the sacredness of the number six could account for the cosmic order, a philosophical rejection that also had mathematical implications.\n\nKepler's most innovative mathematical approach came with his consideration of the five regular solids to explain the planetary orbits. This idea was based on the mathematical principle that only five different regular solids are possible, due to the sum of the plane angles at a corner of a regular solid being less than four right angles. Kepler evolved a scheme where these solids determined the distances between the planets, a direct application of geometric principles to cosmology.\n\nFurthermore, Kepler speculated on the forces acting on the planets, considering whether a moving intelligence in the sun forced the planets around, with this force being strongest for those nearest to the sun and weakening with distance. This speculation, although not directly leading to a successful law connecting distances and periods, shows Kepler's attempt to integrate physical principles (akin to what would later be understood as gravitational force) with his mathematical and philosophical inquiries.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's efforts were underpinned by a blend of philosophical speculation about the cosmos's nature and a mathematical approach that sought to apply geometric and numerical relationships to understand the planetary orbits.",

                    "text": "On 21st December, 1571, at Weil in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, was born a weak and sickly seven-months' child, to whom his parents Henry and Catherine Kepler gave the name of John. Henry Kepler was a petty officer in the service of the reigning Duke, and in 1576 joined the army serving in the Netherlands. His wife followed him, leaving her young son in his grandfather's care at Leonberg, where he barely recovered from a severe attack of smallpox. It was from this place that John derived the Latinised name of Leonmontanus, in accordance with the common practice of the time, but he was not known by it to any great extent. He was sent to school in 1577, but in the following year his father returned to Germany, almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he had become surety. Henry Kepler was obliged to sell his house and most of his belongings, and to keep a tavern at Elmendingen, withdrawing his son from school to help him with the rough work. In 1583 young Kepler was sent to the school at Elmendingen, and in 1584 had another narrow escape from death by a violent illness. In 1586 he was sent, at the charges of the Duke, to the monastic school of Maulbronn; from whence, in accordance with the school regulations, he passed at the end of his first year the examination for the bachelor's degree at Tübingen, returning for two more years as a \"veteran\" to Maulbronn before being admitted as a resident student at Tübingen. The three years thus spent at Maulbronn were marked by recurrences of several of the diseases from which he had suffered in childhood, and also by family troubles at his home. His father went away after a quarrel with his wife Catherine, and died abroad. Catherine herself, who seems to have been of a very unamiable disposition, next quarrelled with her own relatives. It is not surprising therefore that Kepler after taking his M.A. degree in August, 1591, coming out second in the examination lists, was ready to accept the first appointment offered him, even if it should involve leaving home. This happened to be the lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, the chief town in Styria. Kepler's knowledge of astronomy was limited to the compulsory school course, nor had he as yet any particular leaning towards the science; the post, moreover, was a meagre and unimportant one. On the other hand he had frequently expressed disgust at the way in which one after another of his companions had refused \"foreign\" appointments which had been arranged for them under the Duke's scheme of education. His tutors also strongly urged him to accept the lectureship, and he had not the usual reluctance to leave home. He therefore proceeded to Gratz, protesting that he did not thereby forfeit his claim to a more promising opening, when such should appear. His astronomical tutor, Maestlin, encouraged him to devote himself to his newly adopted science, and the first result of this advice appeared before very long in Kepler's \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\". The bent of his mind was towards philosophical speculation, to which he had been attracted in his youthful studies of Scaliger's \"Exoteric Exercises\". He says he devoted much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of fountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents and inland seas, and things of this sort\". Following his tutor in his admiration for the Copernican theory, he wrote an essay on the primary motion, attributing it to the rotation of the earth, and this not for the mathematical reasons brought forward by Copernicus, but, as he himself says, on physical or metaphysical grounds. In 1595, having more leisure from lectures, he turned his speculative mind to the number, size, and motion of the planetary orbits. He first tried simple numerical relations, but none of them appeared to be twice, thrice, or four times as great as another, although he felt convinced that there was some relation between the motions and the distances, seeing that when a gap appeared in one series, there was a corresponding gap in the other. These gaps he attempted to fill by hypothetical planets between Mars and Jupiter, and between Mercury and Venus, but this method also failed to provide the regular proportion which he sought, besides being open to the objection that on the same principle there might be many more equally invisible planets at either end of the series. He was nevertheless unwilling to adopt the opinion of Rheticus that the number six was sacred, maintaining that the \"sacredness\" of the number was of much more recent date than the creation of the worlds, and could not therefore account for it. He next tried an ingenious idea, comparing the perpendiculars from different points of a quadrant of a circle on a tangent at its extremity. The greatest of these, the tangent, not being cut by the quadrant, he called the line of the sun, and associated with infinite force. The shortest, being the point at the other end of the quadrant, thus corresponded to the fixed stars or zero force; intermediate ones were to be found proportional to the \"forces\" of the six planets. After a great amount of unfinished trial calculations, which took nearly a whole summer, he convinced himself that success did not lie that way. In July, 1595, while lecturing on the great planetary conjunctions, he drew quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac showing the slow progression of these points of conjunction at intervals of just over 240° or eight signs. The successive chords marked out a smaller circle to which they were tangents, about half the diameter of the zodiacal circle as drawn, and Kepler at once saw a similarity to the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter, the radius of the inscribed circle of an equilateral triangle being half that of the circumscribed circle. His natural sequence of ideas impelled him to try a square, in the hope that the circumscribed and inscribed circles might give him a similar \"analogy\" for the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. He next tried a pentagon and so on, but he soon noted that he would never reach the sun that way, nor would he find any such limitation as six, the number of \"possibles\" being obviously infinite. The actual planets moreover were not even six but only five, so far as he knew, so he next pondered the question of what sort of things these could be of which only five different figures were possible and suddenly thought of the five regular solids.[2] He immediately pounced upon this idea and ultimately evolved the following scheme. \"The earth is the sphere, the measure of all; round it describe a dodecahedron; the sphere including this will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; the sphere including this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere including this will be Saturn. Now, inscribe in the earth an icosahedron, the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus: inscribe an octahedron in Venus: the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury.\" With this result Kepler was inordinately pleased, and regretted not a moment of the time spent in obtaining it, though to us this \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" can only appear useless, even without the more recent additions to the known planets. He admitted that a certain thickness must be assigned to the intervening spheres to cover the greatest and least distances of the several planets from the sun, but even then some of the numbers obtained are not a very close fit for the corresponding planetary orbits. Kepler's own suggested explanation of the discordances was that they must be due to erroneous measures of the planetary distances, and this, in those days of crude and infrequent observations, could not easily be disproved. He next thought of a variety of reasons why the five regular solids should occur in precisely the order given and in no other, diverging from this into a subtle and not very intelligible process of reasoning to account for the division of the zodiac into 360°. The next subject was more important, and dealt with the relation between the distances of the planets and their times of revolution round the sun. It was obvious that the period was not simply proportional to the distance, as the outer planets were all too slow for this, and he concluded \"either that the moving intelligences of the planets are weakest in those that are farthest from the sun, or that there is one moving intelligence in the sun, the common centre, forcing them all round, but those most violently which are nearest, and that it languishes in some sort and grows weaker at the most distant, because of the remoteness and the attenuation of the virtue\". This is not so near a guess at the theory of gravitation as might be supposed, for Kepler imagined that a repulsive force was necessary to account for the planets being sometimes further from the sun, and so laid aside the idea of a constant attractive force. He made several other attempts to find a law connecting the distances and periods of the planets, but without success at that time, and only desisted when by unconsciously arguing in a circle he appeared to get the same result from two totally different hypotheses. He sent copies of his book to several leading astronomers, of whom Galileo praised his ingenuity and good faith, while Tycho Brahe was evidently much struck with the work and advised him to adapt something similar to the Tychonic system instead of the Copernican. He also intimated that his Uraniborg observations would provide more accurate determinations of the planetary orbits, and thus made Kepler eager to visit him, a project which as we shall see was more than fulfilled. Another copy of the book Kepler sent to Reymers the Imperial astronomer with a most fulsome letter, which Tycho, who asserted that Reymers had simply plagiarised his work, very strongly resented, thus drawing from Kepler a long letter of apology. About the same time Kepler had married a lady already twice widowed, and become involved in difficulties with her relatives on financial grounds, and with the Styrian authorities in connection with the religious disputes then coming to a head. On account of these latter he thought it expedient, the year after his marriage, to withdraw to Hungary, from whence he sent short treatises to Tübingen, \"On the magnet\" (following the ideas of Gilbert of Colchester), \"On the cause of the obliquity of the ecliptic\" and \"On the Divine wisdom as shown in the Creation\". His next important step makes it desirable to devote a chapter to a short notice of Tycho Brahe.",

Despite facing family hardships and health issues, Kepler's academic path led him to Maulbronn and later Tübingen, where he excelled in his studies. Eventually, he accepted a lectureship in astronomy in Gratz, despite his initial lack of interest in the subject. Encouraged by his tutor Maestlin, Kepler delved into philosophical and astronomical speculations, leading to his work \"Mysterium Cosmographicum.\" He explored numerical relations of planetary orbits, proposed hypothetical planets, and eventually pondered the concept of the five regular solids to explain planetary distances. Kepler's work received mixed reviews from astronomers like Galileo and Tycho Brahe, with the latter suggesting adjustments to the Copernican system. The paragraph concludes with Kepler's marriage, financial troubles, and relocation to Hungary due to religious disputes, marking a significant transition in his life and work.",

Initially, he tried simple numerical relations but found them inadequate. Kepler then attempted to fill gaps in the series of planetary motions and distances by introducing hypothetical planets between Mars and Jupiter, and between Mercury and Venus. However, this method failed to provide the regular proportion he sought. Subsequently, he explored geometric shapes and their relationships to planetary orbits. Kepler drew quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac, which led him to consider inscribed and circumscribed circles of different shapes like squares, pentagons, and ultimately the five regular solids. He associated each of these shapes with a planet, creating a speculative model of the solar system based on these geometric figures.\n\nIn summary, Kepler attempted to establish a numerical relation between planetary motions and distances by exploring hypothetical planets and geometric shapes as representations of planetary orbits.",

            "text": "The age following that of Copernicus produced three outstanding figures associated with the science of astronomy, then reaching the close of what Professor Forbes so aptly styles the geometrical period. These three Sir David Brewster has termed \"Martyrs of Science\"; Galileo, the great Italian philosopher, has his own place among the \"Pioneers of Science\"; and invaluable though Tycho Brahe's work was, the latter can hardly be claimed as a pioneer in the same sense as the other two. Nevertheless, Kepler, the third member of the trio, could not have made his most valuable discoveries without Tycho's observations.\n\nOf noble family, born a twin on 14th December, 1546, at Knudstrup in Scania (the southernmost part of Sweden, then forming part of the kingdom of Denmark), Tycho was kidnapped a year later by a childless uncle. This uncle brought him up as his own son, provided him at the age of seven with a tutor, and sent him in 1559 to the University of Copenhagen, to study for a political career by taking courses in rhetoric and philosophy. On 21st August, 1560, however, a solar eclipse took place, total in Portugal, and therefore of small proportions in Denmark, and Tycho's keen interest was awakened, not so much by the phenomenon, as by the fact that it had occurred according to prediction. Soon afterwards he purchased an edition of Ptolemy in order to read up the subject of astronomy, to which, and to mathematics, he devoted most of the remainder of his three years' course at Copenhagen. His uncle next sent him to Leipzig to study law, but he managed to continue his astronomical researches. He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic Tables, but soon found that the latter, though more accurate than the former, failed to represent the true positions of the planets, and grasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to determine the true motions. He began by observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found the Prutenic Tables several days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month. He provided himself with a cross-staff for determining the angular distance between stars or other objects, and, finding the divisions of the scale inaccurate, constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that seems to have been a decided innovation, the previous practice having been to use the best available instrument and ignore its errors. About this time war broke out between Denmark and Sweden, and Tycho returned to his uncle, who was vice-admiral and attached to the king's suite. The uncle died in the following month, and early in the next year Tycho went abroad again, this time to Wittenberg. After five months, however, an outbreak of plague drove him away, and he matriculated at Rostock, where he found little astronomy but a good deal of astrology. While there he fought a duel in the dark and lost part of his nose, which he replaced by a composition of gold and silver. He carried on regular observations with his cross-staff and persevered with his astronomical studies in spite of the objections and want of sympathy of his fellow-countrymen. The King of Denmark, however, having a higher opinion of the value of science, promised Tycho the first canonry that should fall vacant in the cathedral chapter of Roskilde, so that he might be assured of an income while devoting himself to financially unproductive work. In 1568 Tycho left Rostock, and matriculated at Basle, but soon moved on to Augsburg, where he found more enthusiasm for astronomy, and induced one of his new friends to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant of heavy oak beams. This was the first of the series of great instruments associated with Tycho's name, and it remained in use for five years, being destroyed by a great storm in 1574. Tycho meanwhile had left Augsburg in 1570 and returned to live with his father, now governor of Helsingborg Castle, until the latter's death in the following year. Tycho then joined his mother's brother, Steen Bille, the only one of his relatives who showed any sympathy with his desire for a scientific career.\n\nOn 11th November, 1572, Tycho noticed an unfamiliar bright star in the constellation of Cassiopeia, and continued to observe it with a sextant. It was a very brilliant object, equal to Venus at its brightest for the rest of November, not falling below the first magnitude for another four months, and remaining visible for more than a year afterwards. Tycho wrote a little book on the new star, maintaining that it had practically no parallax, and therefore could not be, as some supposed, a comet. Deeming authorship beneath the dignity of a noble he was very reluctant to publish, but he was convinced of the importance of increasing the number and accuracy of observations, though he was by no means free from all the erroneous ideas of his time. The little book contained a certain amount of astrology, but Tycho evidently did not regard this as of very great importance. He adopted the view that the very rarity of the phenomenon of a new star must prevent the formulation and adoption of definite rules for determining its significance. We gather from lectures which he was persuaded to deliver at the University of Copenhagen that, though in agreement with the accepted canons of astrology as to the influence of planetary conjunctions and such phenomena on the course of human events, he did not consider the fate predicted by anyone's horoscope to be unavoidable, but thought the great value of astrology lay in the warnings derived from such computations, which should enable the believer to avoid threatened calamities. In 1575 he left Denmark once more and made his way to Cassel, where he found a kindred spirit in the studious Landgrave, William IV. of Hesse, whose astronomical pursuits had been interrupted by his accession to the government of Hesse, in 1567. Tycho observed with him for some time, the two forming a firm friendship, and then visited successively Frankfort, Basle, and Venice, returning by way of Augsburg, Ratisbon, and Saalfeld to Wittenberg; on the way he acquired various astronomical manuscripts, made friends among practical astronomers, and examined new instruments. He seemed to have considered the advantages of the several places thus visited and decided on Basle, but on his return to Denmark to fetch his family with the object of transferring them to Basle, he found that his friend the Landgrave had written to King Frederick on his behalf, urging him to provide the means to enable Tycho to pursue his astronomical work, promising that not only should credit result for the king and for Denmark but that science itself would be greatly advanced. The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far removed from the distractions of court life. Here Tycho built his celebrated observatory of Uraniborg and began observations in December, 1576, using the large instruments then found necessary in order to attain the accuracy of observation which within the next half-century was to be so greatly facilitated by the invention of the telescope. Here also he built several smaller observing rooms, so that his pupils should be able to observe independently. For more than twenty years he continued his observations at Uraniborg, surrounded by his family, and attracting numerous pupils. His constant aim was to accumulate a large store of observations of a high order of accuracy, and thus to provide data for the complete reform of astronomy. As we have seen, few of the Danish nobles had any sympathy with Tycho's pursuits, and most of them strongly resented the continual expense borne by the King's treasury. Tycho moreover was so absorbed in his scientific pursuits that he would not take the trouble to be a good landlord, nor to carry out all the duties laid upon him in return for certain of his grants of income. His buildings included a chemical laboratory, and he was in the habit of making up elixirs for various medical purposes; these were quite popular, particularly as he made no charge for them. He seems to have been something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulphur to cure infectious diseases \"brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis\"!\n\nKing Frederick, in consideration of various grants to Tycho, relied upon his assistance in scientific matters, and especially in astrological calculations; such as the horoscope of the heir apparent, Prince Christian, born in 1577, which has been preserved among Tycho's writings. There is, however, no known copy in existence of any of the series of annual almanacs with predictions which he prepared for the King. In November, 1577, appeared a bright comet, which Tycho carefully observed with his sextant, proving that it had no perceptible parallax, and must therefore be further off than the moon. He thus definitely overthrew the common belief in the atmospheric origin of comets, which he had himself hitherto shared. With increasing accuracy he observed several other comets, notably one in 1585, when he had a full equipment of instruments and a large staff of assistants. The year 1588, which saw the death of his royal benefactor, saw also the publication of a volume of Tycho's great work \"Introduction to the New Astronomy\". The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations involved so much research to correct the star places for refraction, precession, etc.; it was not completed in fact until Tycho's death, but the second volume, dealing with the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations it included an account of Tycho's system of the world. He would not accept the Copernican system, as he considered the earth too heavy and sluggish to move, and also that the authority of Scripture was against such an hypothesis. He therefore assumed that the other planets revolved about the sun, while the sun, moon, and stars revolved about the earth as a centre. Geometrically this is much the same as the Copernican system, but physically it involves the grotesque demand that the whole system of stars revolves round our insignificant little earth every twenty-four hours. Since his previous small book on the comet, Tycho had evidently considered more fully its possible astrological significance, for he foretold a religious war, giving the date of its commencement, and also the rising of a great Protestant champion. These predictions were apparently fulfilled almost to the letter by the great religious wars that broke out towards the end of the sixteenth century, and in the person of Gustavus Adolphus.\n\nKing Frederick's death did not at first affect Tycho's position, for the new king, Christian, was only eleven years old, and for some years the council of regents included two of his supporters. After their deaths, however, his emoluments began to be cut down on the plea of economy, and as he took very little trouble to carry out any other than scientific duties it was easy enough for his enemies to find fault. One after another source of income was cut off, but he persevered with his scientific work, including a catalogue of stars. He had obtained plenty of good observations of 777 stars, but thought his catalogue should contain 1000 stars, so he hastily observed as many more as he could up to the time of his leaving Hveen, though even then he had not completed his programme. About the time that King Christian reached the age of eighteen, Tycho began to look about for a new patron, and to consider the prospects offered by transferring himself with his instruments and activities to the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II. In 1597, when even his pension from the Royal treasury was cut off, he hurriedly packed up his instruments and library, and after a few weeks' sojourn at Copenhagen, proceeded to Rostock, in Mecklenburg, whence he sent an appeal to King Christian. It is possible that had he done this before leaving Hveen it might have had more effect, but it can be readily seen from the tone of the king's unfavourable reply that his departure was regarded as an aggravation of previous shortcomings. Driven from Rostock by the plague, Tycho settled temporarily at Wandsbeck, in Holstein, but towards the end of 1598 set out to meet the Emperor at Prague. Once more plague intervened and he spent some time at Dresden, afterwards going to Wittenberg for the winter. He ultimately reached Prague in June, 1599. Rudolph granted him a salary of at least 3000 florins, promising also to settle on him the first hereditary estate that should lapse to the Crown. He offered, moreover, the choice between three castles outside Prague, of which Tycho chose Benatek. There he set about altering the buildings in readiness for his instruments, for which he sent to Uraniborg. Before they reached him, after many vexatious delays, he had given up waiting for the funds promised for his building expenses, and removed from Benatek to Prague. It was during this interval that after considerable negotiation, Kepler, who had been in correspondence with Tycho, consented to join him as an assistant. Another assistant, Longomontanus, who had been with Tycho at Uraniborg, was finding difficulty with the long series of Mars observations, and it was arranged that he should transfer his energies to the lunar observations, leaving those of Mars for Kepler. Before very much could be done with them, however, Tycho died at the end of October, 1601. He may have regretted the peaceful island of Hveen, considering the troubles in which Bohemia was rapidly becoming involved, but there is little doubt that had it not been for his self-imposed exile, his observations would not have come into Kepler's hands, and their great value might have been lost. In any case it was at Uraniborg that the mass of observations was produced upon which the fame of Tycho Brahe rests. His own discoveries, though in themselves the most important made in astronomy for many centuries, are far less valuable than those for which his observations furnished the material. He discovered the third and fourth inequalities of the moon in longitude, called respectively the variation and the annual equation, also the variability of the motion of the moon's nodes and the inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic. He obtained an improved value of the constant of precession, and did good service by rejecting the idea that it was variable, an idea which, under the name of trepidation, had for many centuries been accepted. He discovered the effect of refraction, though only approximately its amount, and determined improved values of many other astronomical constants, but singularly enough made no determination of the distance of the sun, adopting instead the ancient and erroneous value given by Hipparchus.\nHis magnificent Observatory of Uraniborg, the finest building for astronomical purposes that the world had hitherto seen, was allowed to fall into decay, and scarcely more than mere indications of the site may now be seen.",

                            "text": "Chapter III of Walter W. Bryant's book \"Kepler\" delves into the life and contributions of Tycho Brahe, a pivotal figure in the transition from the geometrical period of astronomy to a more observational and empirical approach. Born into nobility in 1546, Tycho's astronomical journey began with a solar eclipse in 1560, sparking a lifelong dedication to the science. Despite initial studies aimed at a political career, Tycho's fascination with the stars led him to Leipzig and then across Europe, where he honed his observational skills and constructed innovative instruments, such as a large quadrant and a cross-staff with a novel correction table.\n\nTycho's observations were meticulous and groundbreaking. In 1572, he discovered a new star in Cassiopeia, challenging contemporary astronomical theories with his assertion that it lacked parallax, implying it was far beyond the Earth. This discovery, along with his detailed observations of comets, contradicted the prevailing belief in their atmospheric origin and suggested they orbited beyond the moon. Tycho's work culminated in the construction of Uraniborg, an advanced observatory on the island of Hveen, funded by King Frederick of Denmark. Here, Tycho amassed a wealth of accurate astronomical data, including observations of 777 stars and significant discoveries such as the moon's inequalities and the effect of refraction.\n\nDespite his noble status, Tycho faced challenges, including financial cuts and a lack of support from the Danish nobility, leading him to seek patronage elsewhere. In 1597, he moved to Prague under the patronage of Emperor Rudolph II, where he continued his work until his death in 1601. It was in Prague that Tycho's collaboration with Johannes Kepler began, a partnership that would eventually lead to Kepler's own monumental discoveries based on Tycho's observations.\n\nTycho Brahe's legacy is profound. His refusal to accept the Copernican system in totality led him to propose a hybrid model, where planets revolved around the sun, which, along with the moon and stars, orbited the Earth. While this model was not accurate, Tycho's observational data provided the foundation for Kepler's laws of planetary motion, marking a significant advancement in astronomy. Tycho's insistence on the importance of precise observational data over theoretical speculation set a new standard in astronomy, making him a crucial figure in the scientific revolution and paving the way for future discoveries. His observatory, Uraniborg, though now in ruins, symbolizes the zenith of pre-telescopic astronomy and Tycho's unparalleled contribution to the field.",

Each of these individuals made unique contributions to the field of astronomy:\n\n1. **Galileo**: The text refers to Galileo as the \"great Italian philosopher\" who has his own place among the \"Pioneers of Science.\" While the text does not detail Galileo's specific contributions within this chapter, it acknowledges his significant status in the scientific community, implying his pioneering work in using telescopic observations to support the heliocentric model and discovering celestial bodies such as the moons of Jupiter.\n\n2. **Tycho Brahe**: Tycho's work is described as invaluable, and although he is not claimed as a pioneer in the same sense as Galileo and Kepler, his contributions were essential for Kepler's discoveries. Tycho is noted for his accurate and continuous observations which were crucial in determining the true motions of planets. He began by observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 1563, finding significant errors in the existing astronomical tables. Tycho also constructed a large 19-foot quadrant for observations and developed a more accurate method for measuring angular distances between stars. His observations of a bright star in Cassiopeia in 1572 and his detailed study of comets, particularly proving that comets were further off than the moon and not atmospheric phenomena, are highlighted. Tycho's system of the world, which assumed that other planets revolved about the sun while the sun, moon, and stars revolved about the earth, is also mentioned as a significant, though incorrect, contribution.\n\n3. **Kepler**: While the text primarily focuses on Tycho Brahe's life and work, it acknowledges Kepler as the third member of the trio, whose most valuable discoveries were made possible by Tycho's observations. Kepler's specific contributions are not detailed in this chapter, but it is implied that his work built upon Tycho's accurate observations, leading to groundbreaking laws of planetary motion.\n\nIn summary, Galileo is recognized for his pioneering observational work and support of the heliocentric model, Tycho Brahe for his meticulous and accurate astronomical observations and development of instruments, and Kepler for his theoretical advancements that were made possible by Tycho's observations.",

                                    "text": "Tycho Brahe's noble background and early life experiences significantly influenced his career in astronomy in several ways, as detailed in the provided text. \n\nFirstly, his noble family status provided him with opportunities that were likely unavailable to those of lower social standings. Being of noble birth, he was kidnapped by a childless uncle who then brought him up as his own son. This familial connection ensured that Tycho was well-provided for from a young age, as his uncle \"provided him at the age of seven with a tutor, and sent him in 1559 to the University of Copenhagen, to study for a political career by taking courses in rhetoric and philosophy.\" This early education laid the groundwork for his intellectual development, even though his career path eventually diverged from politics to astronomy.\n\nSecondly, his noble status and the support from his family allowed him to pursue his interests in astronomy. After his initial exposure to astronomy following a solar eclipse in 1560, Tycho was able to purchase an edition of Ptolemy and devote himself to the study of astronomy and mathematics, despite being officially sent to Leipzig to study law. This indicates that his family's resources and status provided him with the means to follow his passion.\n\nFurthermore, Tycho's noble background may have contributed to his confidence and ambition. For instance, after observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn and finding existing astronomical tables to be inaccurate, he did not hesitate to begin his own observations and construct a table of corrections. This initiative suggests that his upbringing instilled in him the belief that he could contribute meaningfully to the field of astronomy.\n\nHis noble status also played a role in his ability to secure patronage for his astronomical work. The King of Denmark, valuing the importance of science, promised Tycho a canonry to ensure he had an income while devoting himself to astronomy. This kind of royal patronage, which was crucial for Tycho's later achievements, was more readily accessible to someone of his noble standing and connections.\n\nLastly, despite his noble birth, Tycho showed a remarkable dedication to his scientific pursuits, often at the expense of his duties as a landlord and nobleman. This dedication led to the construction of the Uraniborg observatory and significant advancements in astronomy. However, it also caused friction with other nobles and eventually contributed to his financial difficulties, illustrating how his noble background both facilitated and complicated his career.\n\nIn summary, Tycho Brahe's noble background and early life experiences provided him with the educational opportunities, resources, and patronage necessary to pursue his passion for astronomy, significantly influencing the trajectory of his career in the field.",

The text states that his \"keen interest was awakened, not so much by the phenomenon, as by the fact that it had occurred according to prediction.\" This event led him to purchase an edition of Ptolemy to study astronomy further, marking the beginning of his lifelong dedication to the subject.\n\nFollowing this newfound interest, Tycho's educational path shifted significantly towards astronomy and mathematics. Despite being sent to the University of Copenhagen in 1559 to prepare for a political career, with studies focused on rhetoric and philosophy, after the eclipse, he devoted most of his remaining three years at Copenhagen to astronomy and mathematics. This shift in focus is evident as the text mentions, \"to which, and to mathematics, he devoted most of the remainder of his three years' course at Copenhagen.\" \n\nEven when his uncle sent him to Leipzig to study law, Tycho managed to continue his astronomical researches. He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic Tables and began his own observations, which further indicates how his educational and research activities began to reflect his deep interest in astronomy despite the initial direction towards a political career.",

He began by observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found that the Prutenic Tables, which were considered more accurate than the Alphonsine Tables at the time, were several days in error, while the Alphonsine Tables were a whole month off. This discrepancy highlighted the need for more accurate observational data to correct these tables, as mentioned: \"He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic Tables, but soon found that the latter, though more accurate than the former, failed to represent the true positions of the planets, and grasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to determine the true motions.\"\n\nTo improve the accuracy of astronomical observations, Tycho introduced several innovations. One of his first steps was to address the inaccuracies in the instruments used for observations. He provided himself with a cross-staff for determining the angular distance between stars or other objects and, upon finding the divisions of the scale inaccurate, constructed a table of corrections. This was a significant innovation, as the text notes: \"finding the divisions of the scale inaccurate, constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that seems to have been a decided innovation, the previous practice having been to use the best available instrument and ignore its errors.\" This approach marked a departure from the existing practice of ignoring instrument errors, thereby significantly enhancing the precision of astronomical measurements.\n\nFurthermore, Tycho's commitment to improving observational accuracy led him to construct large and more precise instruments. For instance, in Augsburg, he induced a friend to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant of heavy oak beams, which was the first in a series of great instruments associated with Tycho's name. This instrument, and others like it, were crucial for achieving the level of observational accuracy Tycho deemed necessary for the reform of astronomy.\n\nIn summary, Tycho Brahe challenged the accuracy of existing astronomical tables through his observations that identified significant errors in them. He introduced innovations such as the construction of a table of corrections for instrument inaccuracies and the development of large, precise instruments, which collectively improved the accuracy of astronomical observations.",

This support is evident in several instances highlighted in the text.\n\nFirstly, the King of Denmark promised Tycho a canonry in the cathedral chapter of Roskilde, \"so that he might be assured of an income while devoting himself to financially unproductive work.\" This gesture indicates the King's recognition of the importance of Tycho's work and his willingness to ensure Tycho had the financial stability needed to continue his research without the burden of financial insecurity.\n\nMoreover, the King's support extended to granting Tycho the small island of Hveen, along with a guaranteed income and a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory. The text specifies, \"The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island.\" This support was crucial in providing Tycho with a dedicated space for his astronomical observations, free from the distractions of court life, and with the financial resources to construct Uraniborg, his celebrated observatory.\n\nThe construction of Uraniborg itself, described as \"the finest building for astronomical purposes that the world had hitherto seen,\" was a direct result of the King's support. This observatory became the center of Tycho's work for over twenty years, where he continued his observations and attracted numerous pupils. The King's backing thus not only facilitated the construction of this significant observatory but also ensured Tycho could focus on accumulating a large store of observations of a high order of accuracy, which was his constant aim.\n\nIn summary, the King of Denmark's role in supporting Tycho Brahe's astronomical pursuits was pivotal, providing him with the financial means and resources to build Uraniborg and continue his research. This support enabled Tycho to make significant contributions to astronomy, laying the groundwork for future discoveries.",

The star was \"a very brilliant object, equal to Venus at its brightest for the rest of November, not falling below the first magnitude for another four months, and remaining visible for more than a year afterwards.\" Tycho's observations led him to maintain that the star had \"practically no parallax,\" implying that it was not a comet as some supposed, but a distant celestial object. This observation was significant because it challenged the Aristotelian belief that the heavens beyond the moon were immutable and unchanging. By demonstrating that new stars could appear, Tycho provided evidence that the heavens were not as static as previously thought.\n\nIn 1577, Tycho observed a bright comet, carefully measuring its position with his sextant. His observations led him to conclude that the comet had \"no perceptible parallax,\" and therefore \"must be further off than the moon.\" This was a groundbreaking discovery because it directly contradicted the common belief of the time that comets were atmospheric phenomena occurring within the Earth's atmosphere. By proving that comets were celestial objects located beyond the moon, Tycho overturned centuries of misconceptions about the nature of comets and their place in the cosmos.\n\nBoth sets of observations were instrumental in challenging and changing the existing astronomical beliefs of the time. Tycho's work with the new star of 1572 and the comet of 1577 demonstrated that the celestial realm was subject to change and that celestial objects such as comets existed beyond the Earth's atmosphere, in the realm of the stars. These findings were pivotal in the shift away from the geocentric models of the universe that had dominated astronomical thought for centuries. Tycho's meticulous observations and his challenges to the prevailing astronomical beliefs laid important groundwork for the future of astronomy, setting the stage for the acceptance of a heliocentric model of the solar system and furthering the scientific revolution in astronomy.",

This support allowed Tycho to dedicate himself to astronomy, accumulating a vast store of accurate observations. However, the narrative indicates that \"few of the Danish nobles had any sympathy with Tycho's pursuits, and most of them strongly resented the continual expense borne by the King's treasury.\" This lack of support among the nobility foreshadows the challenges Tycho would face after King Frederick's death.\n\nThe situation began to change significantly after King Frederick's death. The new king, Christian, was only eleven years old, and while initially, Tycho's position was stable due to a council of regents that included his supporters, this stability was short-lived. After the deaths of his supporters on the council, Tycho's financial support from the royal treasury began to be cut on the plea of economy. The text notes that \"One after another source of income was cut off,\" highlighting the financial difficulties Tycho faced, which were compounded by his reluctance to fulfill duties outside of his scientific work, making it easier for his enemies to criticize him.\n\nFacing these challenges, Tycho began to look for a new patron and considered the prospects of moving his work to the patronage of Emperor Rudolph II. The final straw came in 1597 when even his pension from the Royal treasury was cut off. Tycho then \"hurriedly packed up his instruments and library\" and left Denmark. His departure was seen unfavorably by King Christian, as indicated by the king's unfavourable reply to Tycho's appeal sent from Rostock, suggesting that his leaving was seen as an aggravation of previous shortcomings.\n\nTycho's journey eventually led him to Prague, where Emperor Rudolph II offered him a salary, the promise of an estate, and a choice of castles for his work. This support from Rudolph II allowed Tycho to continue his astronomical research until his death in 1601. The text concludes by reflecting on the importance of Tycho's move, suggesting that \"had it not been for his self-imposed exile, his observations would not have come into Kepler's hands, and their great value might have been lost.\"\n\nThus, Tycho Brahe's departure from Denmark and settlement in Prague were driven by diminishing support and financial backing in Denmark, compounded by the political and economic shifts following King Frederick's death, and culminated in the search for a new patron who could support his astronomical endeavors.",

In 1597, Brahe \"hurriedly packed up his instruments and library\" and left Denmark. By June 1599, he had reached Prague, where Rudolph granted him a salary and promised further support.

This discovery was crucial in understanding the complex motion of the Moon, enhancing the accuracy of lunar models.\n\n2. **Variability of the Motion of the Moon's Nodes and the Inclination of Its Orbit to the Ecliptic**: By identifying these variabilities, Tycho provided insights into the Moon's orbital dynamics, which are essential for both theoretical astronomy and practical navigation.\n\n3. **Improved Value of the Constant of Precession**: Tycho obtained a more accurate value for the precession of the equinoxes, rejecting the previously accepted idea that it was variable (an idea known as trepidation). This was a significant correction to the understanding of the Earth's rotational dynamics and its impact on celestial observations.\n\n4. **Discovery of the Effect of Refraction**: Although he only approximately determined its amount, recognizing the effect of atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations was pivotal. This acknowledgment led to more accurate celestial measurements and observations.\n\n5. **Determination of Improved Values for Many Astronomical Constants**: Tycho's meticulous observations and corrections of astronomical data provided more precise values for various astronomical constants, which are fundamental for the field.\n\nThe text states, \"His own discoveries, though in themselves the most important made in astronomy for many centuries, are far less valuable than those for which his observations furnished the material.\" This highlights that while Tycho's discoveries were groundbreaking, the true value of his work lay in the comprehensive and accurate observational data he collected.

                    "text": "Of noble family, born a twin on 14th December, 1546, at Knudstrup in Scania (the southernmost part of Sweden, then forming part of the kingdom of Denmark), Tycho was kidnapped a year later by a childless uncle. This uncle brought him up as his own son, provided him at the age of seven with a tutor, and sent him in 1559 to the University of Copenhagen, to study for a political career by taking courses in rhetoric and philosophy. On 21st August, 1560, however, a solar eclipse took place, total in Portugal, and therefore of small proportions in Denmark, and Tycho's keen interest was awakened, not so much by the phenomenon, as by the fact that it had occurred according to prediction. Soon afterwards he purchased an edition of Ptolemy in order to read up the subject of astronomy, to which, and to mathematics, he devoted most of the remainder of his three years' course at Copenhagen. His uncle next sent him to Leipzig to study law, but he managed to continue his astronomical researches. He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic Tables, but soon found that the latter, though more accurate than the former, failed to represent the true positions of the planets, and grasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to determine the true motions. He began by observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found the Prutenic Tables several days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month. He provided himself with a cross-staff for determining the angular distance between stars or other objects, and, finding the divisions of the scale inaccurate, constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that seems to have been a decided innovation, the previous practice having been to use the best available instrument and ignore its errors. About this time war broke out between Denmark and Sweden, and Tycho returned to his uncle, who was vice-admiral and attached to the king's suite. The uncle died in the following month, and early in the next year Tycho went abroad again, this time to Wittenberg. After five months, however, an outbreak of plague drove him away, and he matriculated at Rostock, where he found little astronomy but a good deal of astrology. While there he fought a duel in the dark and lost part of his nose, which he replaced by a composition of gold and silver. He carried on regular observations with his cross-staff and persevered with his astronomical studies in spite of the objections and want of sympathy of his fellow-countrymen. The King of Denmark, however, having a higher opinion of the value of science, promised Tycho the first canonry that should fall vacant in the cathedral chapter of Roskilde, so that he might be assured of an income while devoting himself to financially unproductive work. In 1568 Tycho left Rostock, and matriculated at Basle, but soon moved on to Augsburg, where he found more enthusiasm for astronomy, and induced one of his new friends to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant of heavy oak beams. This was the first of the series of great instruments associated with Tycho's name, and it remained in use for five years, being destroyed by a great storm in 1574. Tycho meanwhile had left Augsburg in 1570 and returned to live with his father, now governor of Helsingborg Castle, until the latter's death in the following year. Tycho then joined his mother's brother, Steen Bille, the only one of his relatives who showed any sympathy with his desire for a scientific career.",

This uncle provided Tycho with education and opportunities that shaped his interests and pursuits. Initially intended for a political career, Tycho's curiosity was sparked by an astronomical event, a solar eclipse, which led him to delve into the study of astronomy and mathematics. Despite being sent to study law, Tycho continued his astronomical researches, eventually realizing the importance of continuous observation for determining the true motions of celestial bodies. His family's support, particularly his uncle's encouragement and provision of resources, allowed Tycho to pursue his passion for astronomy, leading to his significant contributions to the field.\n\nIn the provided text, it is stated that Tycho's uncle \"brought him up as his own son, provided him at the age of seven with a tutor\" and that \"his uncle next sent him to Leipzig to study law, but he managed to continue his astronomical researches.\" Additionally, it mentions how Tycho's uncle, who was vice-admiral, supported his scientific endeavors by ensuring financial stability through promises of a canonry.

In Augsburg, Tycho found more enthusiasm for astronomy among the people and even convinced one of his friends to order the construction of a large 19-foot quadrant for astronomical observations. This support and interest in astronomy were lacking during his time in Leipzig and Rostock, where he faced objections and a lack of sympathy from his fellow-countrymen. Additionally, in Augsburg, Tycho was able to have the first of the series of great instruments associated with his name constructed, which remained in use for five years until it was destroyed by a storm in 1574. This stands in contrast to his time in Leipzig and Rostock, where he faced challenges such as a lack of astronomy resources in Rostock and encountering more astrology than astronomy in his studies.",

Initially sent to study law, he continued his astronomical researches and realized the importance of continuous observation to determine the true motions of celestial bodies. He made observations, corrected inaccuracies in instruments, and even innovated by constructing a table of corrections for his cross-staff. Despite facing challenges such as war, lack of sympathy from others, and even losing part of his nose in a duel, Tycho persevered in his astronomical studies. Eventually, he received support from the King of Denmark, who promised him a canonry to ensure financial stability while he pursued his scientific passion. Tycho's interest in astronomy led him to travel to different places, where he encountered varying levels of enthusiasm for the subject, eventually leading to the construction of large astronomical instruments associated with his name.",

This discrepancy led Tycho to realize the importance of continuous observation to determine the true motions of the planets. The text states, \"He found the Prutenic Tables several days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month... grasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to determine the true motions.\" This realization prompted Tycho to improve the accuracy of his observations by constructing a table of corrections for his cross-staff, which was a significant innovation at the time.",

Firstly, he realized the importance of continuous observation to determine the true motions of celestial bodies.

The text states, \"He began by observing a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found the Prutenic Tables several days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month... constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that seems to have been a decided innovation.\" \n\nAdditionally, Tycho's dedication to his astronomical studies despite challenges like war, lack of sympathy from others, and personal setbacks like losing part of his nose in a duel, showcases his perseverance and commitment to advancing observational astronomy. This determination is highlighted in the text when it mentions, \"He carried on regular observations with his cross-staff and persevered with his astronomical studies in spite of the objections and want of sympathy of his fellow-countrymen.\"\n\nTherefore, Tycho Brahe's innovative approach to correcting observational tools and his unwavering commitment to his studies despite adversities were key factors that contributed to advancements in observational astronomy during his time.",

                    "text": "On 11th November, 1572, Tycho noticed an unfamiliar bright star in the constellation of Cassiopeia, and continued to observe it with a sextant. It was a very brilliant object, equal to Venus at its brightest for the rest of November, not falling below the first magnitude for another four months, and remaining visible for more than a year afterwards. Tycho wrote a little book on the new star, maintaining that it had practically no parallax, and therefore could not be, as some supposed, a comet. Deeming authorship beneath the dignity of a noble he was very reluctant to publish, but he was convinced of the importance of increasing the number and accuracy of observations, though he was by no means free from all the erroneous ideas of his time. The little book contained a certain amount of astrology, but Tycho evidently did not regard this as of very great importance. He adopted the view that the very rarity of the phenomenon of a new star must prevent the formulation and adoption of definite rules for determining its significance. We gather from lectures which he was persuaded to deliver at the University of Copenhagen that, though in agreement with the accepted canons of astrology as to the influence of planetary conjunctions and such phenomena on the course of human events, he did not consider the fate predicted by anyone's horoscope to be unavoidable, but thought the great value of astrology lay in the warnings derived from such computations, which should enable the believer to avoid threatened calamities. In 1575 he left Denmark once more and made his way to Cassel, where he found a kindred spirit in the studious Landgrave, William IV. of Hesse, whose astronomical pursuits had been interrupted by his accession to the government of Hesse, in 1567. Tycho observed with him for some time, the two forming a firm friendship, and then visited successively Frankfort, Basle, and Venice, returning by way of Augsburg, Ratisbon, and Saalfeld to Wittenberg; on the way he acquired various astronomical manuscripts, made friends among practical astronomers, and examined new instruments. He seemed to have considered the advantages of the several places thus visited and decided on Basle, but on his return to Denmark to fetch his family with the object of transferring them to Basle, he found that his friend the Landgrave had written to King Frederick on his behalf, urging him to provide the means to enable Tycho to pursue his astronomical work, promising that not only should credit result for the king and for Denmark but that science itself would be greatly advanced. The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far removed from the distractions of court life. Here Tycho built his celebrated observatory of Uraniborg and began observations in December, 1576, using the large instruments then found necessary in order to attain the accuracy of observation which within the next half-century was to be so greatly facilitated by the invention of the telescope. Here also he built several smaller observing rooms, so that his pupils should be able to observe independently. For more than twenty years he continued his observations at Uraniborg, surrounded by his family, and attracting numerous pupils. His constant aim was to accumulate a large store of observations of a high order of accuracy, and thus to provide data for the complete reform of astronomy. As we have seen, few of the Danish nobles had any sympathy with Tycho's pursuits, and most of them strongly resented the continual expense borne by the King's treasury. Tycho moreover was so absorbed in his scientific pursuits that he would not take the trouble to be a good landlord, nor to carry out all the duties laid upon him in return for certain of his grants of income. His buildings included a chemical laboratory, and he was in the habit of making up elixirs for various medical purposes; these were quite popular, particularly as he made no charge for them. He seems to have been something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulphur to cure infectious diseases \"brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis\"!",

It also touches on Tycho's travels to Cassel, his friendship with Landgrave William IV of Hesse, and his establishment of the Uraniborg observatory on the island of Hveen. Tycho's dedication to accumulating precise observations for the advancement of astronomy is underscored, alongside his unconventional practices as a landlord and his interest in alchemy for medical purposes, showcasing his multifaceted interests and contributions to science during this period.",

As a result of this letter, King Frederick granted Tycho a small island of Hveen in the Sound, along with a guaranteed income and a large sum from the treasury for constructing an observatory. This support allowed Tycho to establish his celebrated observatory of Uraniborg and commence observations there in December 1576. The text states, \"on his return to Denmark to fetch his family with the object of transferring them to Basle, he found that his friend the Landgrave had written to King Frederick on his behalf, urging him to provide the means to enable Tycho to pursue his astronomical work, promising that not only should credit result for the king and for Denmark but that science itself would be greatly advanced. The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far removed from the distractions of court life.\"",

There is, however, no known copy in existence of any of the series of annual almanacs with predictions which he prepared for the King. In November, 1577, appeared a bright comet, which Tycho carefully observed with his sextant, proving that it had no perceptible parallax, and must therefore be further off than the moon. He thus definitely overthrew the common belief in the atmospheric origin of comets, which he had himself hitherto shared. With increasing accuracy he observed several other comets, notably one in 1585, when he had a full equipment of instruments and a large staff of assistants. The year 1588, which saw the death of his royal benefactor, saw also the publication of a volume of Tycho's great work \"Introduction to the New Astronomy\". The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations involved so much research to correct the star places for refraction, precession, etc.; it was not completed in fact until Tycho's death, but the second volume, dealing with the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations it included an account of Tycho's system of the world. He would not accept the Copernican system, as he considered the earth too heavy and sluggish to move, and also that the authority of Scripture was against such an hypothesis. He therefore assumed that the other planets revolved about the sun, while the sun, moon, and stars revolved about the earth as a centre. Geometrically this is much the same as the Copernican system, but physically it involves the grotesque demand that the whole system of stars revolves round our insignificant little earth every twenty-four hours. Since his previous small book on the comet, Tycho had evidently considered more fully its possible astrological significance, for he foretold a religious war, giving the date of its commencement, and also the rising of a great Protestant champion. These predictions were apparently fulfilled almost to the letter by the great religious wars that broke out towards the end of the sixteenth century, and in the person of Gustavus Adolphus.",

In November 1577, Tycho observed a bright comet with his sextant and proved that it had no perceptible parallax, indicating it was farther away than the moon. This observation led him to overturn the prevailing belief in the atmospheric origin of comets, a belief he himself had previously held. By observing several other comets with increasing accuracy, especially one in 1585 with a full set of instruments and assistants, Tycho expanded his knowledge of celestial bodies. Additionally, his observations on comets, including the one in 1577, were included in his work \"Introduction to the New Astronomy,\" which also presented his system of the world. Despite not accepting the Copernican system, Tycho proposed a model where planets revolved around the sun while the sun, moon, and stars revolved around the earth. This work showcased Tycho's dedication to meticulous observation and analysis, contributing to his comprehensive astronomical understanding.",

Tycho also innovated by constructing a table of corrections for his instruments, which was a departure from the previous practice of ignoring instrument errors. Additionally, Tycho's commitment to accumulating a large store of accurate observations for the reform of astronomy set him apart from others who might not have prioritized such meticulous data collection. This dedication to observation and accuracy is highlighted in the text: \"His constant aim was to accumulate a large store of observations of a high order of accuracy, and thus to provide data for the complete reform of astronomy.\"",

Later on, Tycho had a large 19-foot quadrant made of heavy oak beams ordered by one of his friends in Augsburg. This quadrant was the first of the series of great instruments associated with Tycho's name. Additionally, he built his celebrated observatory of Uraniborg on the island of Hveen, equipped with large instruments necessary for accurate observations.

He also maintained a sense of duty towards his family, as seen when he lived with his father and later joined his sympathetic uncle, Steen Bille, who understood and supported Tycho's passion for science. Additionally, Tycho's observatory on the island of Hveen allowed him to focus on his astronomical observations away from the distractions of court life. This is evident in the text: \"The ultimate result of this letter was that after refusing various offers, Tycho accepted from the king a grant of the small island of Hveen, in the Sound, with a guaranteed income, in addition to a large sum from the treasury for building an observatory on the island, far removed from the distractions of court life.\" Tycho's ability to navigate his scientific pursuits alongside his familial and royal obligations showcases his commitment to both his work and his relationships.",

The paragraph states, \"In November, 1577, appeared a bright comet, which Tycho carefully observed with his sextant, proving that it had no perceptible parallax, and must therefore be further off than the moon.\" This demonstrates Tycho's meticulous observations and his contributions to understanding celestial bodies like comets.\n\nFurthermore, Tycho's rejection of the Copernican system is highlighted in the text, where he presents his own model where \"the other planets revolved about the sun, while the sun, moon, and stars revolved about the earth as a centre.\" Tycho's geocentric view was influenced by his belief in the heaviness of the Earth and his interpretation of Scripture, as mentioned in the paragraph: \"He would not accept the Copernican system, as he considered the earth too heavy and sluggish to move, and also that the authority of Scripture was against such an hypothesis.\"\n\nLastly, Tycho delved into the astrological significance of celestial events in his work. He made predictions about future events based on his astronomical observations, such as foreseeing a religious war and the rise of a Protestant champion. The paragraph states, \"Since his previous small book on the comet, Tycho had evidently considered more fully its possible astrological significance, for he foretold a religious war, giving the date of its commencement, and also the rising of a great Protestant champion.\" This shows how Tycho integrated astrology into his astronomical studies and how he believed in the predictive power of celestial events.",

Tycho's model was described as \"physically it involves the grotesque demand that the whole system of stars revolves round our insignificant little earth every twenty-four hours.\"\n\nReligiously, Tycho's beliefs were influenced by his interpretation of Scripture, as he believed that the Copernican system went against the authority of Scripture. He also considered the astrological significance of celestial events, as seen when he made predictions about a religious war and the rising of a great Protestant champion based on his observations of comets. These predictions were seen as fulfilled by the religious wars that occurred towards the end of the sixteenth century and the emergence of Gustavus Adolphus.\n\nIn summary, Tycho's beliefs about the universe reflected the scientific debate between heliocentrism and geocentrism, as well as his religious beliefs and interpretations of celestial events in relation to historical and religious contexts of his time.",

After their deaths, however, his emoluments began to be cut down on the plea of economy, and as he took very little trouble to carry out any other than scientific duties it was easy enough for his enemies to find fault. One after another source of income was cut off, but he persevered with his scientific work, including a catalogue of stars. He had obtained plenty of good observations of 777 stars, but thought his catalogue should contain 1000 stars, so he hastily observed as many more as he could up to the time of his leaving Hveen, though even then he had not completed his programme. About the time that King Christian reached the age of eighteen, Tycho began to look about for a new patron, and to consider the prospects offered by transferring himself with his instruments and activities to the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II. In 1597, when even his pension from the Royal treasury was cut off, he hurriedly packed up his instruments and library, and after a few weeks' sojourn at Copenhagen, proceeded to Rostock, in Mecklenburg, whence he sent an appeal to King Christian. It is possible that had he done this before leaving Hveen it might have had more effect, but it can be readily seen from the tone of the king's unfavourable reply that his departure was regarded as an aggravation of previous shortcomings. Driven from Rostock by the plague, Tycho settled temporarily at Wandsbeck, in Holstein, but towards the end of 1598 set out to meet the Emperor at Prague. Once more plague intervened and he spent some time at Dresden, afterwards going to Wittenberg for the winter. He ultimately reached Prague in June, 1599. Rudolph granted him a salary of at least 3000 florins, promising also to settle on him the first hereditary estate that should lapse to the Crown. He offered, moreover, the choice between three castles outside Prague, of which Tycho chose Benatek. There he set about altering the buildings in readiness for his instruments, for which he sent to Uraniborg. Before they reached him, after many vexatious delays, he had given up waiting for the funds promised for his building expenses, and removed from Benatek to Prague. It was during this interval that after considerable negotiation, Kepler, who had been in correspondence with Tycho, consented to join him as an assistant. Another assistant, Longomontanus, who had been with Tycho at Uraniborg, was finding difficulty with the long series of Mars observations, and it was arranged that he should transfer his energies to the lunar observations, leaving those of Mars for Kepler. Before very much could be done with them, however, Tycho died at the end of October, 1601. He may have regretted the peaceful island of Hveen, considering the troubles in which Bohemia was rapidly becoming involved, but there is little doubt that had it not been for his self-imposed exile, his observations would not have come into Kepler's hands, and their great value might have been lost. In any case it was at Uraniborg that the mass of observations was produced upon which the fame of Tycho Brahe rests. His own discoveries, though in themselves the most important made in astronomy for many centuries, are far less valuable than those for which his observations furnished the material. He discovered the third and fourth inequalities of the moon in longitude, called respectively the variation and the annual equation, also the variability of the motion of the moon's nodes and the inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic. He obtained an improved value of the constant of precession, and did good service by rejecting the idea that it was variable, an idea which, under the name of trepidation, had for many centuries been accepted. He discovered the effect of refraction, though only approximately its amount, and determined improved values of many other astronomical constants, but singularly enough made no determination of the distance of the sun, adopting instead the ancient and erroneous value given by Hipparchus.\nHis magnificent Observatory of Uraniborg, the finest building for astronomical purposes that the world had hitherto seen, was allowed to fall into decay, and scarcely more than mere indications of the site may now be seen.",

Despite this, Tycho persisted in his scientific endeavors, particularly in compiling a star catalog. He aimed to expand his catalog from 777 to 1000 stars, hastily observing more stars before leaving Hveen. As King Christian came of age, Tycho sought a new patron, eventually considering Emperor Rudolph II. Facing financial setbacks, including the termination of his pension, Tycho relocated to Prague with Rudolph's support. The narrative details Tycho's efforts to secure funding for his astronomical work, his move to Benatek, and later to Prague. It highlights his collaboration with Kepler and Longomontanus, focusing on their astronomical observations. The paragraph concludes with Tycho's passing in 1601, reflecting on his legacy of groundbreaking astronomical discoveries and the importance of his meticulous observations, emphasizing the significance of his work conducted at Uraniborg.",

He began to look for a new patron and considered transferring himself, along with his instruments and activities, to the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II. Tycho then packed up his instruments and library, left Hveen, and went to Rostock in Mecklenburg. From there, he sent an appeal to King Christian, but the response was unfavorable due to his departure being seen as an aggravation of previous shortcomings. Tycho then settled temporarily at Wandsbeck in Holstein before heading to Prague to meet the Emperor. Despite facing challenges with delays in promised funds for building expenses, Tycho ultimately settled in Benatek, where he prepared the buildings for his instruments. However, due to the delays in receiving the funds, he moved to Prague. It was during this time that he negotiated with Kepler to join him as an assistant, and Longomontanus was also involved in the observations. Unfortunately, Tycho passed away at the end of October 1601 before much could be done with the observations.",

            "text": "The association of Kepler with Tycho was one of the most important landmarks in the history of astronomy. The younger man hoped, by the aid of Tycho's planetary observations, to obtain better support for some of his fanciful speculative theories, while the latter, who had certainly not gained in prestige by leaving Denmark, was in great need of a competent staff of assistants. Of the two it would almost seem that Tycho thought himself the greater gainer, for in spite of his reputation for brusqueness and want of consideration, he not only made light of Kepler's apology in the matter of Reymers, but treated him with uniform kindness in the face of great rudeness and ingratitude. He begged him to come \"as a welcome friend,\" though Kepler, very touchy on the subject of his own astronomical powers, was afraid he might be regarded as simply a subordinate assistant. An arrangement had been suggested by which Kepler should obtain two years' leave of absence from Gratz on full pay, which, because of the higher cost of living in Prague, should be supplemented by the Emperor; but before this could be concluded, Kepler threw up his professorship, and thinking he had thereby also lost the chance of going to Prague, applied to Maestlin and others of his Tübingen friends to make interest for him with the Duke of Wurtemberg and secure the professorship of medicine. Tycho, however, still urged him to come to Prague, promising to do his utmost to secure for him a permanent appointment, or in any event to see that he was not the loser by coming. Kepler was delayed by illness on the way, but ultimately reached Prague, accompanied by his wife, and for some time lived entirely at Tycho's expense, writing by way of return essays against Reymers and another man, who had claimed the credit of the Tychonic system. This Kepler could do with a clear conscience, as it was only a question of priority and did not involve any support of the system, which he deemed far inferior to that of Copernicus. The following year saw friction between the two astronomers, and we learn from Kepler's abject letter of apology that he was entirely in the wrong. It was about money matters, which in one way or another embittered the rest of Kepler's life, and it arose during his absence from Prague. On his return in September, 1601, Tycho presented him to the Emperor, who gave him the title of Imperial Mathematician, on condition of assisting Tycho in his calculations, the very thing Kepler was most anxious to be allowed to do: for nowhere else in the world was there such a collection of good observations sufficient for his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy. The Emperor's interest was still mainly with astrology, but he liked to think that his name would be handed down to posterity in connection with the new Planetary Tables in the same way as that of Alphonso of Castile, and he made liberal promises to pay the expenses. Tycho's other principal assistant, Longomontanus, did not stay long after giving up the Mars observations to Kepler, but instead of working at the new lunar theory, suddenly left to take up a professorship of astronomy in his native Denmark. Very shortly afterwards Tycho himself died of acute distemper; Kepler began to prepare the mass of manuscripts for publication, but, as everything was claimed by the Brahe family, he was not allowed to finish the work. He succeeded to Tycho's post of principal mathematician to the Emperor, at a reduced official salary, which owing to the emptiness of the Imperial treasury was almost always in arrear. In order to meet his expenses he had recourse to the casting of nativities, for which he gained considerable reputation and received very good pay. He worked by the conventional rules of astrology, and was quite prepared to take fees for so doing, although he had very little faith in them, preferring his own fanciful ideas.\n\nIn 1604 the constellation of Cassiopeia was once more temporarily enriched by the appearance of a new star, said by some to be brighter than Tycho's nova, and by others to be twice as bright as Jupiter. Kepler at once wrote a short account of it, from which may be gathered some idea of his attitude towards astrology. Contrasting the two novae, he says: \"Yonder one chose for its appearance a time no way remarkable, and came into the world quite unexpectedly, like an enemy storming a town and breaking into the market-place before the citizens are aware of his approach; but ours has come exactly in the year of which astrologers have written so much about the fiery trigon that happens in it; just in the month in which (according to Cyprian), Mars comes up to a very perfect conjunction with the other two superior planets; just in the day when Mars has joined Jupiter, and just in the region where this conjunction has taken place. Therefore the apparition of this star is not like a secret hostile irruption, as was that one of 1572, but the spectacle of a public triumph, or the entry of a mighty potentate; when the couriers ride in some time before to prepare his lodgings, and the crowd of young urchins begin to think the time over long to wait, then roll in, one after another, the ammunition and money, and baggage waggons, and presently the trampling of horse and the rush of people from every side to the streets and windows; and when the crowd have gazed with their jaws all agape at the troops of knights; then at last the trumpeters and archers and lackeys so distinguish the person of the monarch, that there is no occasion to point him out, but every one cries of his own accord--'Here we have him'. What it may portend is hard to determine, and this much only is certain, that it comes to tell mankind either nothing at all or high and mighty news, quite beyond human sense and understanding. It will have an important influence on political and social relations; not indeed by its own nature, but as it were accidentally through the disposition of mankind. First, it portends to the booksellers great disturbances and tolerable gains; for almost every _Theologus_, _Philosophicus_, _Medicus_, and _Mathematicus_, or whoever else, having no laborious occupation entrusted to him, seeks his pleasure _in studiis_, will make particular remarks upon it, and will wish to bring these remarks to the light. Just so will others, learned and unlearned, wish to know its meaning, and they will buy the authors who profess to tell them. I mention these things merely by way of example, because although thus much can be easily predicted without great skill, yet may it happen just as easily, and in the same manner, that the vulgar, or whoever else is of easy faith, or, it may be, crazy, may wish to exalt himself into a great prophet; or it may even happen that some powerful lord, who has good foundation and beginning of great dignities, will be cheered on by this phenomenon to venture on some new scheme, just as if God had set up this star in the darkness merely to enlighten them.\" He made no secret of his views on conventional astrology, as to which he claimed to speak with the authority of one fully conversant with its principles, but he nevertheless expressed his sincere conviction that the conjunctions and aspects of the planets certainly did affect things on the earth, maintaining that he was driven to this belief against his will by \"most unfailing experiences\".\n\nMeanwhile the projected Rudolphine Tables were continually delayed by the want of money. Kepler's nominal salary should have been ample for his expenses, increased though they were by his growing family, but in the depleted state of the treasury there were many who objected to any payment for such \"unpractical\" purposes. This particular attitude has not been confined to any special epoch or country, but the obvious result in Kepler's case was to compel him to apply himself to less expensive matters than the Planetary Tables, and among these must be included not only the horoscopes or nativities, which owing to his reputation were always in demand, but also other writings which probably did not pay so well. In 1604 he published \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\" containing the earliest known reasonable theory of optics, and especially of dioptrics or vision through lenses. He compared the mechanism of the eye with that of Porta's \"Camera Obscura,\" but made no attempt to explain how the image formed on the retina is understood by the brain. He went carefully into the question of refraction, the importance of which Tycho had been the first astronomer to recognise, though he only applied it at low altitudes, and had not arrived at a true theory or accurate values. Kepler wasted a good deal of time and ingenuity on trial theories. He would invariably start with some hypothesis, and work out the effect. He would then test it by experiment, and when it failed would at once recognise that his hypothesis was _a priori_ bound to fail. He rarely seems to have noticed the fatal objections in time to save himself trouble. He would then at once start again on a new hypothesis, equally gratuitous and equally unfounded. It never seems to have occurred to him that there might be a better way of approaching a problem. Among the lines he followed in this particular investigation were, first, that refraction depends only on the angle of incidence, which, he says, cannot be correct as it would thus be the same for all refracting substances; next, that it depended also on the density of the medium. This was a good shot, but he unfortunately assumed that all rays passing into a denser medium would apparently penetrate it to a depth depending only on the medium, which means that there is a constant ratio between the tangents, instead of the sines, of the inclination of the incident and refracted rays to the normal. Experiment proved that this gave too high values for refraction near the vertical compared with those near the horizon, so Kepler \"went off at a tangent\" and tried a totally new set of ideas, which all reduced to the absurdity of a refraction which vanished at the horizon. These were followed by another set, involving either a constant amount of refraction or one becoming infinite. He then came to the conclusion that these geometrical methods must fail because the refracted image is not real, and determined to try by analogy only, comparing the equally unreal image formed by a mirror with that formed by refraction in water. He noticed how the bottom of a vessel containing water appears to rise more and more away from the vertical, and at once jumped to the analogy of a concave mirror, which magnifies the image, while a convex mirror was likened to a rarer medium. This line of attack also failed him, as did various attempts to find relations between his measurements of refraction and conic sections, and he broke off suddenly with a diatribe against Tycho's critics, whom he likened to blind men disputing about colours. Not many years later Snell discovered the true law of refraction, but Kepler's contribution to the subject, though he failed to discover the actual law, includes several of the adopted \"by-laws\". He noted that atmospheric refraction would alter with the height of the atmosphere and with temperature, and also recognised the fact that rainbow colours depend on the angle of refraction, whether seen in the rainbow itself, or in dew, glass, water, or any similar medium. He thus came near to anticipating Newton. Before leaving the subject of Kepler's optics it will be well to recall that a few years later after hearing of Galileo's telescope, Kepler suggested that for astronomical purposes two convex lenses should be used, so that there should be a real image where measuring wires could be placed for reference. He did not carry out the idea himself, and it was left to the Englishman Gascoigne to produce the first instrument on this \"Keplerian\" principle, universally known as the Astronomical Telescope.\n\nIn 1606 came a second treatise on the new star, discussing various theories to account for its appearance, and refusing to accept the notion that it was a \"fortuitous concourse of atoms\". This was followed in 1607 by a treatise on comets, suggested by the comet appearing that year, known as Halley's comet after its next return. He regarded comets as \"planets\" moving in straight lines, never having examined sufficient observations of any comet to convince himself that their paths are curved. If he had not assumed that they were external to the system and so could not be expected to return, he might have anticipated Halley's discovery. Another suggestive remark of his was to the effect that the planets must be self-luminous, as otherwise Mercury and Venus, at any rate, ought to show phases. This was put to the test not long afterwards by means of Galileo's telescope.\nIn 1607 Kepler rushed into print with an alleged observation of Mercury crossing the sun, but after Galileo's discovery of sun-spots, Kepler at once cheerfully retracted his observation of \"Mercury,\" and so far was he from being annoyed or bigoted in his views, that he warmly adopted Galileo's side, in contrast to most of those whose opinions were liable to be overthrown by the new discoveries. Maestlin and others of Kepler's friends took the opposite view.",

                            "text": "Chapter IV of Walter W. Bryant's book on Kepler delves into the pivotal collaboration between Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe, marking a significant period in the advancement of astronomy. This partnership was characterized by a blend of mutual benefit and personal challenges, with Kepler seeking to refine his speculative theories through Tycho's precise planetary observations, and Tycho, having lost some prestige after leaving Denmark, in need of skilled assistants. Despite initial reservations and misunderstandings, Tycho welcomed Kepler warmly to Prague, promising support and ultimately securing for him the title of Imperial Mathematician from the Emperor, who was more interested in astrology but recognized the importance of their astronomical work.\n\nKepler's tenure in Prague was not without its difficulties, including financial strains exacerbated by his growing family and the delayed payment of his salary due to the depleted state of the Imperial treasury. These challenges forced Kepler to engage in less financially demanding work, including casting nativities, which, despite his skepticism of conventional astrology, provided a steady income. His work during this period also included significant contributions to optics, particularly in dioptrics, and the publication of treatises on the new star in Cassiopeia and comets, showcasing his innovative thinking and willingness to revise his theories in light of new evidence.\n\nThe chapter highlights Kepler's intellectual rigor and openness to new ideas, as evidenced by his enthusiastic adoption of Galileo's discoveries, which contrasted with the skepticism of some contemporaries. Despite the personal and professional obstacles he faced, Kepler's work laid foundational stones for future astronomical discoveries, demonstrating his critical role in the transition from speculative to empirical science in the field of astronomy. Bryant's narrative captures the essence of Kepler's journey, marked by his relentless pursuit of knowledge, his contributions to the scientific method, and his complex relationship with Tycho Brahe, which, despite its challenges, proved to be immensely fruitful for the advancement of astronomy.",

This partnership is highlighted by the text stating, \"The association of Kepler with Tycho was one of the most important landmarks in the history of astronomy.\" Kepler, the younger of the two, sought to leverage Tycho's detailed planetary observations to provide empirical support for his own speculative theories. On the other hand, Tycho, who had lost some prestige by leaving Denmark, was in dire need of competent assistants to continue his work. This mutual need facilitated a collaboration that was beneficial to both parties and, by extension, to the field of astronomy as a whole.\n\nTycho valued Kepler's contribution highly, as indicated by his welcoming attitude towards Kepler, despite Kepler's initial concerns about being seen merely as a subordinate assistant. Tycho's encouragement for Kepler to join him in Prague, promising to secure a permanent appointment for him, underscores the significance Tycho placed on this partnership. This collaboration ultimately led to Kepler being presented to the Emperor and receiving the title of Imperial Mathematician, a position that allowed him to assist Tycho with calculations that were crucial for advancing astronomical theory.\n\nThe text further illustrates the importance of their association in the development of significant astronomical works and theories. For instance, after Tycho's death, Kepler succeeded him as the principal mathematician to the Emperor and continued working on the Rudolphine Tables, which were delayed due to financial issues but were crucial for the reform of astronomical theory. Moreover, Kepler's work in optics, including his publication \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\" and his suggestions for improving the telescope, were influenced by his association with Tycho and their shared commitment to empirical observation and theoretical innovation.\n\nIn summary, the significance of the association between Kepler and Tycho in the history of astronomy lies in their combined efforts to refine and advance astronomical knowledge through meticulous observation, theoretical speculation, and the application of mathematical calculations to celestial phenomena. Their partnership not only facilitated significant personal achievements but also laid the groundwork for future discoveries in astronomy.",

Kepler hoped to use Tycho's planetary observations to obtain better support for his \"fanciful speculative theories.\" He was looking for empirical data to bolster his theoretical work in astronomy, which he believed could be achieved through Tycho's detailed observations. On the other hand, Tycho, who had lost some prestige by leaving Denmark, was in great need of a competent staff of assistants. He saw in Kepler not just an assistant but a valuable collaborator who could help him with his astronomical calculations and observations.\n\nThe text indicates that Tycho might have considered himself the greater gainer from the collaboration, as he treated Kepler with kindness despite Kepler's rudeness and ingratitude, suggesting Tycho's high regard for Kepler's potential contribution to his work. Tycho even urged Kepler to come to Prague, promising to do his utmost to secure for him a permanent appointment, or at least ensure he was not the loser by coming. This shows that Tycho recognized the value Kepler could add to his work and was willing to support him to facilitate their collaboration.\n\nFrom the collaboration, Kepler benefited by being presented to the Emperor by Tycho, which led to him being given the title of Imperial Mathematician on the condition of assisting Tycho with his calculations. This position was exactly what Kepler wanted, as it provided him access to \"such a collection of good observations sufficient for his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy.\" Thus, the collaboration met Kepler's initial expectation of finding empirical support for his theories, and it also offered him a prestigious position that allowed him to work towards his goal of astronomical reform.\n\nIn summary, Tycho benefited from gaining a competent and intellectually valuable assistant in Kepler, while Kepler benefited from access to Tycho's observations and a position that allowed him to pursue his astronomical research. Their initial expectations—Kepler's hope for empirical data to support his theories and Tycho's need for a skilled assistant—were both met through their collaboration, making it a mutually beneficial partnership.",

This welcoming attitude was significant, especially considering Kepler's touchiness about his astronomical abilities. Tycho's invitation was extended in spite of Kepler's rudeness and ingratitude, showing Tycho's willingness to overlook personal grievances for the sake of collaboration (\"he not only made light of Kepler's apology in the matter of Reymers, but treated him with uniform kindness\").\n\n2. **Financial Support**: Tycho promised to do his utmost to secure a permanent appointment for Kepler or to ensure that Kepler would not be financially worse off by coming to Prague. This promise was crucial for Kepler, who had financial concerns and had even thrown up his professorship in anticipation of moving to Prague. Tycho's support extended to covering Kepler's living expenses when Kepler and his wife lived entirely at Tycho's expense upon their arrival in Prague (\"for some time lived entirely at Tycho's expense\").\n\n3. **Professional Opportunities**: Tycho presented Kepler to the Emperor, leading to Kepler being given the title of Imperial Mathematician.

The text mentions, \"The Emperor's interest was still mainly with astrology, but he liked to think that his name would be handed down to posterity in connection with the new Planetary Tables in the same way as that of Alphonso of Castile,\" indicating that the Emperor's vanity or desire for a lasting legacy in the realm of science was a driving force behind his support for Kepler's work.

                                    "text": "Financial difficulties significantly impacted the progress of the Rudolphine Tables and Kepler's other scientific endeavors in several ways. The text outlines how Kepler's nominal salary, which was supposed to be ample for his expenses, was adversely affected by the depleted state of the treasury. This financial strain was a direct result of the broader economic challenges facing the empire, leading to many objecting to any payment for what they considered \"unpractical\" purposes. The text states, \"Meanwhile the projected Rudolphine Tables were continually delayed by the want of money.\" This indicates that the lack of funds directly hindered the development and completion of the Rudolphine Tables, a major scientific project of Kepler's.\n\nFurthermore, the financial difficulties forced Kepler to divert his attention away from expensive projects like the Planetary Tables to less costly endeavors. The text elaborates, \"This particular attitude has not been confined to any special epoch or country, but the obvious result in Kepler's case was to compel him to apply himself to less expensive matters than the Planetary Tables.\" This redirection of focus due to financial constraints meant that Kepler had to prioritize work that was more immediately lucrative, such as casting horoscopes or nativities, which were always in demand due to his reputation. The text mentions, \"among these must be included not only the horoscopes or nativities, which owing to his reputation were always in demand, but also other writings which probably did not pay so well.\"\n\nAdditionally, Kepler's financial difficulties led him to engage in activities that, while financially rewarding, were not his primary interest or aligned with his scientific beliefs. For instance, despite having little faith in the conventional rules of astrology, Kepler resorted to casting nativities to meet his expenses, as indicated by the text: \"In order to meet his expenses he had recourse to the casting of nativities, for which he gained considerable reputation and received very good pay.\"\n\nOverall, the financial difficulties faced by Kepler had a profound impact on his scientific work, causing delays in his major projects like the Rudolphine Tables, compelling him to focus on less expensive and sometimes less scientifically significant endeavors, and pushing him towards activities that were more about financial necessity than scientific inquiry.",

His work led to the earliest known reasonable theory of optics, particularly focusing on dioptrics, which is the study of refraction through lenses. The text outlines several key aspects of his contributions and the evolution of his hypotheses through experimentation:\n\n1. **Comparison with Camera Obscura**: Kepler compared the mechanism of the eye with that of Porta's \"Camera Obscura,\" a foundational step in understanding how vision works. This analogy helped in conceptualizing how images are formed and perceived, although Kepler did not delve into how the brain interprets these images.\n\n2. **Investigation into Refraction**: Kepler went into detail about the question of refraction, recognizing its importance in optics. Tycho had previously recognized the significance of refraction, especially at low altitudes, but it was Kepler who pushed the investigation further. He experimented with various hypotheses regarding refraction, including its dependence on the angle of incidence and the density of the medium.\n\n3. **Trial Theories and Experimentation**: Kepler's approach to understanding refraction involved starting with hypotheses and then testing them through experiments. When a hypothesis failed, he would acknowledge its failure and move on to a new hypothesis. This iterative process, although it did not lead him to discover the true law of refraction, showcased his methodical approach to scientific inquiry.\n\n4. **Contributions Despite Failures**: Despite not discovering the actual law of refraction (later discovered by Snell), Kepler's work included several important \"by-laws.\" He noted that atmospheric refraction changes with the height of the atmosphere and temperature. He also recognized that rainbow colors depend on the angle of refraction, a realization that brought him close to anticipating Newton's work on light and color.\n\n5. **Suggestion for Astronomical Telescope**: Kepler suggested using two convex lenses for astronomical purposes to create a real image where measuring wires could be placed for reference. This idea, which he did not implement himself, laid the groundwork for the \"Keplerian\" principle in telescopes, later realized by the Englishman Gascoigne as the Astronomical Telescope.\n\nKepler's work in optics was characterized by a willingness to explore and revise his hypotheses based on experimental evidence. His contributions, particularly in dioptrics and the understanding of refraction, laid important groundwork for future discoveries in the field of optics.",

Regarding new stars, Kepler wrote about the constellation of Cassiopeia being temporarily enriched by the appearance of a new star in 1604, which some said was brighter than Tycho's nova and others claimed was twice as bright as Jupiter. He pondered the astrological significance of such events, suggesting that the star's appearance was not random but rather significant, indicating either \"nothing at all or high and mighty news, quite beyond human sense and understanding.\" He believed that celestial events like the appearance of new stars had an important influence on political and social relations, albeit indirectly through human interpretation and reaction rather than through their inherent nature (\"It will have an important influence on political and social relations; not indeed by its own nature, but as it were accidentally through the disposition of mankind\").\n\nIn terms of comets, Kepler regarded them as \"planets\" moving in straight lines, a view that stemmed from his lack of examination of sufficient observations to convince him of their curved paths. This perspective led him to miss the possibility that comets could be external to the system and return, a discovery later made by Halley (\"He regarded comets as 'planets' moving in straight lines, never having examined sufficient observations of any comet to convince himself that their paths are curved\").\n\nComparing Kepler's views with later astronomical discoveries, it's clear that while he was on the cusp of significant insights, he did not reach the accurate conclusions that came with further observation and technological advancement. For instance, his speculation about comets moving in straight lines contrasts with the later discovery of their elliptical orbits, as famously demonstrated by Halley. Additionally, his musings on the astrological significance of new stars and their impact on human affairs show a blend of scientific curiosity and the astrological beliefs of his time, a stance that would shift as astronomy became more empirically grounded in the centuries that followed. Kepler's suggestion that planets must be self-luminous, because otherwise Mercury and Venus ought to show phases, was a hypothesis put to the test and confirmed by Galileo's telescopic observations, showing that Kepler was on the right track in some of his speculations, even if he did not have the means to verify them himself.",

This shows Kepler's willingness to correct his own mistakes in light of new evidence. Secondly, Kepler's response to Galileo's discoveries was not only to correct himself but also to actively support Galileo, as he \"warmly adopted Galileo's side, in contrast to most of those whose opinions were liable to be overthrown by the new discoveries.\" This indicates that Kepler valued the advancement of scientific knowledge over personal pride or the maintenance of previously held beliefs. \n\nThese actions demonstrate Kepler's commitment to scientific truth and his readiness to embrace and advocate for new ideas, even when they contradicted his own previous observations or the prevailing views of his contemporaries.",

                    "text": "The association of Kepler with Tycho was one of the most important landmarks in the history of astronomy. The younger man hoped, by the aid of Tycho's planetary observations, to obtain better support for some of his fanciful speculative theories, while the latter, who had certainly not gained in prestige by leaving Denmark, was in great need of a competent staff of assistants. Of the two it would almost seem that Tycho thought himself the greater gainer, for in spite of his reputation for brusqueness and want of consideration, he not only made light of Kepler's apology in the matter of Reymers, but treated him with uniform kindness in the face of great rudeness and ingratitude. He begged him to come \"as a welcome friend,\" though Kepler, very touchy on the subject of his own astronomical powers, was afraid he might be regarded as simply a subordinate assistant. An arrangement had been suggested by which Kepler should obtain two years' leave of absence from Gratz on full pay, which, because of the higher cost of living in Prague, should be supplemented by the Emperor; but before this could be concluded, Kepler threw up his professorship, and thinking he had thereby also lost the chance of going to Prague, applied to Maestlin and others of his Tübingen friends to make interest for him with the Duke of Wurtemberg and secure the professorship of medicine. Tycho, however, still urged him to come to Prague, promising to do his utmost to secure for him a permanent appointment, or in any event to see that he was not the loser by coming. Kepler was delayed by illness on the way, but ultimately reached Prague, accompanied by his wife, and for some time lived entirely at Tycho's expense, writing by way of return essays against Reymers and another man, who had claimed the credit of the Tychonic system. This Kepler could do with a clear conscience, as it was only a question of priority and did not involve any support of the system, which he deemed far inferior to that of Copernicus. The following year saw friction between the two astronomers, and we learn from Kepler's abject letter of apology that he was entirely in the wrong. It was about money matters, which in one way or another embittered the rest of Kepler's life, and it arose during his absence from Prague. On his return in September, 1601, Tycho presented him to the Emperor, who gave him the title of Imperial Mathematician, on condition of assisting Tycho in his calculations, the very thing Kepler was most anxious to be allowed to do: for nowhere else in the world was there such a collection of good observations sufficient for his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy. The Emperor's interest was still mainly with astrology, but he liked to think that his name would be handed down to posterity in connection with the new Planetary Tables in the same way as that of Alphonso of Castile, and he made liberal promises to pay the expenses. Tycho's other principal assistant, Longomontanus, did not stay long after giving up the Mars observations to Kepler, but instead of working at the new lunar theory, suddenly left to take up a professorship of astronomy in his native Denmark. Very shortly afterwards Tycho himself died of acute distemper; Kepler began to prepare the mass of manuscripts for publication, but, as everything was claimed by the Brahe family, he was not allowed to finish the work. He succeeded to Tycho's post of principal mathematician to the Emperor, at a reduced official salary, which owing to the emptiness of the Imperial treasury was almost always in arrear. In order to meet his expenses he had recourse to the casting of nativities, for which he gained considerable reputation and received very good pay. He worked by the conventional rules of astrology, and was quite prepared to take fees for so doing, although he had very little faith in them, preferring his own fanciful ideas.",

Kepler hoped to benefit from Tycho's planetary observations to support his speculative theories, while Tycho, in need of competent assistants, welcomed Kepler despite facing rudeness and ingratitude. This partnership provided Kepler with the observational data he needed to reform the theory of astronomy. The text states, \"The younger man hoped, by the aid of Tycho's planetary observations, to obtain better support for some of his fanciful speculative theories,\" highlighting Kepler's reliance on Tycho's observations. Additionally, Tycho's support allowed Kepler to work towards reforming the entire theory of astronomy, as it mentions, \"for nowhere else in the world was there such a collection of good observations sufficient for his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy.\" Thus, the association between Kepler and Tycho was significant in providing Kepler with the necessary observational data to advance astronomical understanding.",

                    "text": "In 1604 the constellation of Cassiopeia was once more temporarily enriched by the appearance of a new star, said by some to be brighter than Tycho's nova, and by others to be twice as bright as Jupiter. Kepler at once wrote a short account of it, from which may be gathered some idea of his attitude towards astrology. Contrasting the two novae, he says: \"Yonder one chose for its appearance a time no way remarkable, and came into the world quite unexpectedly, like an enemy storming a town and breaking into the market-place before the citizens are aware of his approach; but ours has come exactly in the year of which astrologers have written so much about the fiery trigon that happens in it; just in the month in which (according to Cyprian), Mars comes up to a very perfect conjunction with the other two superior planets; just in the day when Mars has joined Jupiter, and just in the region where this conjunction has taken place. Therefore the apparition of this star is not like a secret hostile irruption, as was that one of 1572, but the spectacle of a public triumph, or the entry of a mighty potentate; when the couriers ride in some time before to prepare his lodgings, and the crowd of young urchins begin to think the time over long to wait, then roll in, one after another, the ammunition and money, and baggage waggons, and presently the trampling of horse and the rush of people from every side to the streets and windows; and when the crowd have gazed with their jaws all agape at the troops of knights; then at last the trumpeters and archers and lackeys so distinguish the person of the monarch, that there is no occasion to point him out, but every one cries of his own accord--'Here we have him'. What it may portend is hard to determine, and this much only is certain, that it comes to tell mankind either nothing at all or high and mighty news, quite beyond human sense and understanding. It will have an important influence on political and social relations; not indeed by its own nature, but as it were accidentally through the disposition of mankind. First, it portends to the booksellers great disturbances and tolerable gains; for almost every _Theologus_, _Philosophicus_, _Medicus_, and _Mathematicus_, or whoever else, having no laborious occupation entrusted to him, seeks his pleasure _in studiis_, will make particular remarks upon it, and will wish to bring these remarks to the light. Just so will others, learned and unlearned, wish to know its meaning, and they will buy the authors who profess to tell them. I mention these things merely by way of example, because although thus much can be easily predicted without great skill, yet may it happen just as easily, and in the same manner, that the vulgar, or whoever else is of easy faith, or, it may be, crazy, may wish to exalt himself into a great prophet; or it may even happen that some powerful lord, who has good foundation and beginning of great dignities, will be cheered on by this phenomenon to venture on some new scheme, just as if God had set up this star in the darkness merely to enlighten them.\" He made no secret of his views on conventional astrology, as to which he claimed to speak with the authority of one fully conversant with its principles, but he nevertheless expressed his sincere conviction that the conjunctions and aspects of the planets certainly did affect things on the earth, maintaining that he was driven to this belief against his will by \"most unfailing experiences\".",

He described the new star of 1604 as appearing during a time that astrologers had written about, coinciding with specific planetary alignments. Kepler compared this to the nova of 1572, which appeared unexpectedly. He likened the new star of 1604 to a \"public triumph\" or the entry of a mighty potentate, suggesting a grand and anticipated event. Kepler expressed uncertainty about the exact meaning of the new star but believed it would have an influence on political and social relations. He mentioned that it could lead to various reactions, including scholars writing about it and people seeking to understand its significance. Kepler acknowledged the potential for exaggerated interpretations, mentioning that some might try to elevate themselves as prophets or powerful individuals might be inspired to embark on new endeavors due to the phenomenon. Despite his skepticism towards conventional astrology, Kepler admitted a belief in the influence of planetary positions on earthly matters based on his experiences.",

Kepler justified his belief in the influence of planetary aspects on earthly matters by stating that he was driven to this belief by \"most unfailing experiences.\" He contrasted the appearance of a new star in 1604 with a previous nova, describing the former as a spectacle of a public triumph or the entry of a mighty potentate, suggesting that such celestial events could have significant implications on political and social relations. Kepler also noted that while the new star's appearance might not inherently influence events, it could impact human behavior and decisions indirectly. He mentioned that various individuals, including scholars and authors, would be inspired to interpret and write about the new star, leading to disturbances and gains for booksellers.

In his analysis of the new star, Kepler draws parallels between the appearance of the star and significant astrological events, suggesting a potential impact on political and social relations. He describes the star's appearance as a spectacle of a public triumph or the entry of a mighty potentate, indicating that it may signify high and mighty news beyond human understanding. This aligns with his belief that celestial events could have important influences on human affairs, even if their exact meanings are hard to determine. Kepler acknowledges the potential for various reactions to such celestial events, from scholars seeking to analyze and interpret them to individuals attempting to use them for personal gain or political motives.

                    "text": "Meanwhile the projected Rudolphine Tables were continually delayed by the want of money. Kepler's nominal salary should have been ample for his expenses, increased though they were by his growing family, but in the depleted state of the treasury there were many who objected to any payment for such \"unpractical\" purposes. This particular attitude has not been confined to any special epoch or country, but the obvious result in Kepler's case was to compel him to apply himself to less expensive matters than the Planetary Tables, and among these must be included not only the horoscopes or nativities, which owing to his reputation were always in demand, but also other writings which probably did not pay so well. In 1604 he published \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\" containing the earliest known reasonable theory of optics, and especially of dioptrics or vision through lenses. He compared the mechanism of the eye with that of Porta's \"Camera Obscura,\" but made no attempt to explain how the image formed on the retina is understood by the brain. He went carefully into the question of refraction, the importance of which Tycho had been the first astronomer to recognise, though he only applied it at low altitudes, and had not arrived at a true theory or accurate values. Kepler wasted a good deal of time and ingenuity on trial theories. He would invariably start with some hypothesis, and work out the effect. He would then test it by experiment, and when it failed would at once recognise that his hypothesis was _a priori_ bound to fail. He rarely seems to have noticed the fatal objections in time to save himself trouble. He would then at once start again on a new hypothesis, equally gratuitous and equally unfounded. It never seems to have occurred to him that there might be a better way of approaching a problem. Among the lines he followed in this particular investigation were, first, that refraction depends only on the angle of incidence, which, he says, cannot be correct as it would thus be the same for all refracting substances; next, that it depended also on the density of the medium. This was a good shot, but he unfortunately assumed that all rays passing into a denser medium would apparently penetrate it to a depth depending only on the medium, which means that there is a constant ratio between the tangents, instead of the sines, of the inclination of the incident and refracted rays to the normal. Experiment proved that this gave too high values for refraction near the vertical compared with those near the horizon, so Kepler \"went off at a tangent\" and tried a totally new set of ideas, which all reduced to the absurdity of a refraction which vanished at the horizon. These were followed by another set, involving either a constant amount of refraction or one becoming infinite. He then came to the conclusion that these geometrical methods must fail because the refracted image is not real, and determined to try by analogy only, comparing the equally unreal image formed by a mirror with that formed by refraction in water. He noticed how the bottom of a vessel containing water appears to rise more and more away from the vertical, and at once jumped to the analogy of a concave mirror, which magnifies the image, while a convex mirror was likened to a rarer medium. This line of attack also failed him, as did various attempts to find relations between his measurements of refraction and conic sections, and he broke off suddenly with a diatribe against Tycho's critics, whom he likened to blind men disputing about colours. Not many years later Snell discovered the true law of refraction, but Kepler's contribution to the subject, though he failed to discover the actual law, includes several of the adopted \"by-laws\". He noted that atmospheric refraction would alter with the height of the atmosphere and with temperature, and also recognised the fact that rainbow colours depend on the angle of refraction, whether seen in the rainbow itself, or in dew, glass, water, or any similar medium. He thus came near to anticipating Newton. Before leaving the subject of Kepler's optics it will be well to recall that a few years later after hearing of Galileo's telescope, Kepler suggested that for astronomical purposes two convex lenses should be used, so that there should be a real image where measuring wires could be placed for reference. He did not carry out the idea himself, and it was left to the Englishman Gascoigne to produce the first instrument on this \"Keplerian\" principle, universally known as the Astronomical Telescope.",

Initially, he proposed that refraction depends only on the angle of incidence, but he realized this was incorrect as it would make refraction the same for all substances. He then considered that refraction might also depend on the density of the medium, which was a good attempt. However, he assumed that rays passing into a denser medium would penetrate it to a depth based solely on the medium, leading to incorrect values for refraction. Kepler then explored ideas where refraction either vanished at the horizon or became infinite. He also attempted to find relations between his measurements of refraction and conic sections. Despite these efforts, he concluded that geometrical methods failed because the refracted image is not real, and he shifted to analogies involving mirrors and concave/convex shapes. Ultimately, his investigations contributed to the understanding of refraction, even though he did not discover the true law himself.",

He then shifted to the idea that refraction also depended on the density of the medium, which was a step in the right direction. However, he made assumptions that did not hold true in practice. Kepler's approach involved trial and error, as he would come up with new hypotheses that were equally unfounded when the previous ones failed.

Initially, Kepler believed that refraction depended solely on the angle of incidence, but he realized this could not be correct as it would result in the same refraction for all substances. He then considered that refraction also depended on the density of the medium, which was a good idea, but he made an incorrect assumption that all rays passing into a denser medium would penetrate it to a depth depending only on the medium. This led to a constant ratio between the tangents, instead of the sines, of the incident and refracted rays. Experimentation showed that this approach gave too high values for refraction near the vertical compared to near the horizon. Kepler then tried various new ideas, including ones where refraction vanished at the horizon or became infinite. Ultimately, he concluded that geometrical methods failed because the refracted image is not real, and he decided to approach the problem by analogy, comparing the image formed by refraction in water to that formed by a mirror. Despite his failures in discovering the actual law of refraction, Kepler's contributions included insights that aligned with later discoveries. He recognized that atmospheric refraction would change with the height of the atmosphere and temperature, and he understood that rainbow colors depended on the angle of refraction in various mediums. These observations brought him close to anticipating Newton's work on optics.",

For example, he experimented with different hypotheses on refraction, but they often led to incorrect conclusions. Despite his efforts, Kepler did not discover the true law of refraction. In contrast, Galileo's work with the telescope led to significant advancements in observational astronomy. While Kepler suggested the use of two convex lenses for astronomical purposes, it was an Englishman named Gascoigne who implemented this idea in the first Astronomical Telescope, known as the Keplerian principle. Therefore, Kepler's ideas on optics were more focused on theoretical explorations and experiments, while Galileo's work with the telescope had a more direct impact on observational astronomy.",

He would start with hypotheses, test them through experiments, and when they failed, he would acknowledge the failure but then proceed to create new hypotheses without addressing the fundamental issues. Kepler's approach led to various failed theories and ultimately to a lack of significant progress in his study of optics. For example, he initially proposed that refraction depended only on the angle of incidence, which was proven incorrect. He then moved on to other hypotheses, such as assuming a constant ratio between the tangents of incident and refracted rays, which also proved to be flawed. Despite these setbacks, Kepler did not give up and continued to explore different ideas and analogies, such as comparing refraction in water to the image formed by a mirror. However, his attempts did not lead to a successful explanation of refraction. In response to his critics, Kepler ended his study of optics with a diatribe against Tycho's critics, likening them to blind men disputing about colors. Although Kepler did not discover the true law of refraction, his contributions included insights that were later adopted as \"by-laws\" in the field of optics.",

For example, he noted that \"atmospheric refraction would alter with the height of the atmosphere and with temperature\" and recognized that \"rainbow colors depend on the angle of refraction.\" These insights were significant steps towards anticipating later discoveries in optics, such as those made by Newton.\n\nOn the other hand, Kepler's approach to optics also diverged from the scientific knowledge of his time in some aspects. Kepler's method of trial and error, starting with hypotheses that were often unfounded and then moving on to new ideas when they failed, was not the most effective way to approach scientific problems. He struggled with developing a consistent and accurate theory of refraction, going through various incorrect hypotheses before ultimately concluding that his geometrical methods were inadequate. Despite his efforts, he did not discover the true law of refraction, which was later found by Snell.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's work on optics aligned with the scientific knowledge of his time in terms of recognizing certain optical phenomena but diverged in his methodology and ultimate success in establishing a comprehensive theory of refraction.",

He wasted time and effort on trial theories that often led to dead ends. Kepler would start with a hypothesis, test it through experiments, and if it failed, he would recognize that his initial hypothesis was bound to fail. However, he did not always notice fatal objections in time to avoid unnecessary trouble. For example, he experimented with different ideas regarding refraction, such as assuming that refraction depends only on the angle of incidence or the density of the medium. These attempts led him to erroneous conclusions or impractical outcomes, like a refraction that vanished at the horizon or a constant amount of refraction. Despite his efforts and ingenuity, Kepler's geometric methods failed because he realized that the refracted image was not real. He then attempted to approach the problem through analogies, comparing the image formed by refraction to that formed by mirrors. However, these analogies also did not lead to successful practical applications. In the end, while Kepler made contributions to the subject of optics and noted important aspects like atmospheric refraction and the dependence of rainbow colors on the angle of refraction, he did not discover the true law of refraction. His challenges stemmed from his tendency to rely on hypotheses that did not always align with practical outcomes and his experimental approach that sometimes led him astray before reaching a successful solution.",

In 1604, he published \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\" which contained a reasonable theory of optics, particularly dioptrics or vision through lenses. Kepler compared the mechanism of the eye with Porta's \"Camera Obscura\" and delved into the question of refraction. He experimented with different hypotheses, although some were ultimately unsuccessful. Despite not discovering the true law of refraction, Kepler's work included several principles that later became adopted \"by-laws\" in optics. He also recognized the effects of atmospheric refraction on the height of the atmosphere and temperature, as well as the relationship between rainbow colors and the angle of refraction. Additionally, Kepler's suggestion for using two convex lenses in astronomical instruments, later known as the Astronomical Telescope, influenced the development of telescopes. Although he faced challenges and did not always succeed in his hypotheses, Kepler's work in optics laid the groundwork for future advancements in the field.",

This was followed in 1607 by a treatise on comets, suggested by the comet appearing that year, known as Halley's comet after its next return. He regarded comets as \"planets\" moving in straight lines, never having examined sufficient observations of any comet to convince himself that their paths are curved. If he had not assumed that they were external to the system and so could not be expected to return, he might have anticipated Halley's discovery. Another suggestive remark of his was to the effect that the planets must be self-luminous, as otherwise Mercury and Venus, at any rate, ought to show phases. This was put to the test not long afterwards by means of Galileo's telescope.\nIn 1607 Kepler rushed into print with an alleged observation of Mercury crossing the sun, but after Galileo's discovery of sun-spots, Kepler at once cheerfully retracted his observation of \"Mercury,\" and so far was he from being annoyed or bigoted in his views, that he warmly adopted Galileo's side, in contrast to most of those whose opinions were liable to be overthrown by the new discoveries.

            "text": "When Gilbert of Colchester, in his \"New Philosophy,\" founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that \"subterranean spirits and humours, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers\". It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo's admiration for Gilbert's work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets. The general idea of \"gravity\" opposed the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth on the ground that loose objects would fly off: moreover, the latest refinements of the old system of planetary motions necessitated their orbits being described about a mere empty point. Kepler very strongly combated these notions, pointing out the absurdity of the conclusions to which they tended, and proceeded in set terms to describe his own theory.\n\n\"Every corporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a natural fitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by itself beyond the sphere of influence of a body cognate with it. Gravity is a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth attracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy bodies (if we begin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the world) are not carried to the centre of the world in its quality of centre of the world, but as to the centre of a cognate round body, namely, the earth; so that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or whithersoever it may be carried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will always be carried towards it. If the earth were not round, heavy bodies would not tend from every side in a straight line towards the centre of the earth, but to different points from different sides. If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density. If the earth should cease to attract its waters to itself all the waters of the sea would he raised and would flow to the body of the moon. The sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends as far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies rapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a flow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward. If the attractive virtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it follows with greater reason that the attractive virtue of the earth extends as far as the moon and much farther; and, in short, nothing which consists of earthly substance anyhow constituted although thrown up to any height, can ever escape the powerful operation of this attractive virtue. Nothing which consists of corporeal matter is absolutely light, but that is comparatively lighter which is rarer, either by its own nature, or by accidental heat. And it is not to be thought that light bodies are escaping to the surface of the universe while they are carried upwards, or that they are not attracted by the earth. They are attracted, but in a less degree, and so are driven outwards by the heavy bodies; which being done, they stop, and are kept by the earth in their own place. But although the attractive virtue of the earth extends upwards, as has been said, so very far, yet if any stone should be at a distance great enough to become sensible compared with the earth's diameter, it is true that on the motion of the earth such a stone would not follow altogether; its own force of resistance would be combined with the attractive force of the earth, and thus it would extricate itself in some degree from the motion of the earth.\" The above passage from the Introduction to Kepler's \"Commentaries on the Motion of Mars,\" always regarded as his most valuable work, must have been known to Newton, so that no such incident as the fall of an apple was required to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the genesis of his Theory of Universal Gravitation. Kepler's glimpse at such a theory could have been no more than a glimpse, for he went no further with it. This seems a pity, as it is far less fanciful than many of his ideas, though not free from the \"virtues\" and \"animal faculties,\" that correspond to Gilbert's \"spirits and humours\". We must, however, proceed to the subject of Mars, which was, as before noted, the first important investigation entrusted to Kepler on his arrival at Prague.\n\nThe time taken from one opposition of Mars to the next is decidedly unequal at different parts of his orbit, so that many oppositions must be used to determine the mean motion. The ancients had noticed that what was called the \"second inequality,\" due as we now know to the orbital motion of the earth, only vanished when earth, sun, and planet were in line, i.e. at the planet's opposition; therefore they used oppositions to determine the mean motion, but deemed it necessary to apply a correction to the true opposition to reduce to mean opposition, thus sacrificing part of the advantage of using oppositions. Tycho and Longomontanus had followed this method in their calculations from Tycho's twenty years' observations. Their aim was to find a position of the \"equant,\" such that these observations would show a constant angular motion about it; and that the computed positions would agree in latitude and longitude with the actual observed positions. When Kepler arrived he was told that their longitudes agreed within a couple of minutes of arc, but that something was wrong with the latitudes. He found, however, that even in longitude their positions showed discordances ten times as great as they admitted, and so, to clear the ground of assumptions as far as possible, he determined to use true oppositions. To this Tycho objected, and Kepler had great difficulty in convincing him that the new move would be any improvement, but undertook to prove to him by actual examples that a false position of the orbit could by adjusting the equant be made to fit the longitudes within five minutes of arc, while giving quite erroneous values of the latitudes and second inequalities. To avoid the possibility of further objection he carried out this demonstration separately for each of the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Tycho. For the new method he noticed that great accuracy was required in the reduction of the observed places of Mars to the ecliptic, and for this purpose the value obtained for the parallax by Tycho's assistants fell far short of the requisite accuracy. Kepler therefore was obliged to recompute the parallax from the original observations, as also the position of the line of nodes and the inclination of the orbit. The last he found to be constant, thus corroborating his theory that the plane of the orbit passed through the sun. He repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times (and that before the invention of logarithms), and at length adopted values for the mean longitude and longitude of aphelion. He found no discordance greater than two minutes of arc in Tycho's observed longitudes in opposition, but the latitudes, and also longitudes in other parts of the orbit were much more discordant, and he found to his chagrin that four years' work was practically wasted. Before making a fresh start he looked for some simplification of the labour; and determined to adopt Ptolemy's assumption known as the principle of the bisection of the excentricity. Hitherto, since Ptolemy had given no reason for this assumption, Kepler had preferred not to make it, only taking for granted that the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity (see Figs. 1, 2).\n\nA marked improvement in residuals was the result of this step, proving, so far, the correctness of Ptolemy's principle, but there still remained discordances amounting to eight minutes of arc. Copernicus, who had no idea of the accuracy obtainable in observations, would probably have regarded such an agreement as remarkably good; but Kepler refused to admit the possibility of an error of eight minutes in any of Tycho's observations. He thereupon vowed to construct from these eight minutes a new planetary theory that should account for them all. His repeated failures had by this time convinced him that no uniformly described circle could possibly represent the motion of Mars. Either the orbit could not be circular, or else the angular velocity could not be constant about any point whatever. He determined to attack the \"second inequality,\" i.e. the optical illusion caused by the earth's annual motion, but first revived an old idea of his own that for the sake of uniformity the sun, or as he preferred to regard it, the earth, should have an equant as well as the planets. From the irregularities of the solar motion he soon found that this was the case, and that the motion was uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the centre of the earth's orbit, such that the centre bisected the distance from the sun to the \"Equant\"; this fully supported Ptolemy's principle. Clearly then the earth's linear velocity could not be constant, and Kepler was encouraged to revive another of his speculations as to a force which was weaker at greater distances. He found the velocity greater at the nearer apse, so that the time over an equal arc at either apse was proportional to the distance. He conjectured that this might prove to be true for arcs at all parts of the orbit, and to test this he divided the orbit into 360 equal parts, and calculated the distances to the points of division. Archimedes had obtained an approximation to the area of a circle by dividing it radially into a very large number of triangles, and Kepler had this device in mind. He found that the sums of successive distances from his 360 points were approximately proportional to the times from point to point, and was thus enabled to represent much more accurately the annual motion of the earth which produced the second inequality of Mars, to whose motion he now returned. Three points are sufficient to define a circle, so he took three observed positions of Mars and found a circle; he then took three other positions, but obtained a different circle, and a third set gave yet another. It thus began to appear that the orbit could not be a circle. He next tried to divide into 360 equal parts, as he had in the case of the earth, but the sums of distances failed to fit the times, and he realised that the sums of distances were not a good measure of the area of successive triangles. He noted, however, that the errors at the apses were now smaller than with a central circular orbit, and of the opposite sign, so he determined to try whether an oval orbit would fit better, following a suggestion made by Purbach in the case of Mercury, whose orbit is even more eccentric than that of Mars, though observations were too scanty to form the foundation of any theory. Kepler gave his fancy play in the choice of an oval, greater at one end than the other, endeavouring to satisfy some ideas about epicyclic motion, but could not find a satisfactory curve. He then had the fortunate idea of trying an ellipse with the same axis as his tentative oval. Mars now appeared too slow at the apses instead of too quick, so obviously some intermediate ellipse must be sought between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same axis. At this point the \"long arm of coincidence\" came into play. Half-way between the apses lay the mean distance, and at this position the error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle, amounting to .00429 of a radius. With these figures in his mind, Kepler looked up the greatest optical inequality of Mars, the angle between the straight lines from Mars to the Sun and to the centre of the circle.[3] The secant of this angle was 1.00429, so that he noted that an ellipse reduced from the circle in the ratio of 1.00429 to 1 would fit the motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.\n[Footnote 3: This is clearly a maximum at AMC in Fig. 2, when its tangent AC/CM = the eccentricity.]\n\nIt is often said that a coincidence like this only happens to somebody who \"deserves his luck,\" but this simply means that recognition is essential to the coincidence. In the same way the appearance of one of a large number of people mentioned is hailed as a case of the old adage \"Talk of the devil, etc.,\" ignoring all the people who failed to appear. No one, however, will consider Kepler unduly favoured. His genius, in his case certainly \"an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" enabled him out of his medley of hypotheses, mainly unsound, by dint of enormous labour and patience, to arrive thus at the first two of the laws which established his title of \"Legislator of the Heavens\".\nFIGURES EXPLANATORY OF KEPLER'S THEORY OF THE MOTION OF MARS.\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\n_______ /       \\ /         \\ |           | |___________| Q|  E  C  A  |P |           | \\         / \\_______/\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\n___M___ /___|\\__\\ //  N|\\\\ \\\\ |/    | \\\\ \\| |_____|__\\\\_| Q| E   C   A |P |\\    |    /| \\\\___|___// \\___|___/\n[Transcriber's Note: Approximate renditions of these figures are provided. Fig. 1 is a circle. Fig. 2 is a circle which contains an ellipse, tangent to the circle at Q and P. Line segments from M (on the circle) and N (on the ellipse) meet at point A.]\nFIG. 1.--In Ptolemy's excentric theory, A may be taken to represent the earth, C the centre of a planet's orbit, and E the equant, P (perigee) and Q (apogee) being the apses of the orbit. Ptolemy's idea was that uniform motion in a circle must be provided, and since the motion was not uniform about the earth, A could not coincide with C; and since the motion still failed to be uniform about A or C, some point E must be found about which the motion should be uniform.\n\nFIG. 2.--This is not drawn to scale, but is intended to illustrate Kepler's modification of Ptolemy's excentric. Kepler found velocities at P and Q proportional not to AP and AQ but to AQ and AP, or to EP and EQ if EC = CA (bisection of the excentricity). The velocity at M was wrong, and AM appeared too great. Kepler's first ellipse had M moved too near C. The distance AC is much exaggerated in the figure, as also is MN. AN = CP, the radius of the circle. MN should be .00429 of the radius, and MC/NC should be 1.00429. The velocity at N appeared to be proportional to EN ( = AN). Kepler concluded that Mars moved round PNQ, so that the area described about A (the sun) was equal in equal times, A being the focus of the ellipse PNQ. The angular velocity is not quite constant about E, the equant or empty focus, but the difference could hardly have been detected in Kepler's time.\n\nKepler's improved determination of the earth's orbit was obtained by plotting the different positions of the earth corresponding to successive rotations of Mars, i.e. intervals of 687 days. At each of these the date of the year would give the angle MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth), and Tycho's observation the angle MES. So the triangle could be solved except for scale, and the ratio of SE to SM would give the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed position of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE, showing the earth's inequality. Measuring from a fixed position of the earth, it would give similarly a series of positions of Mars, which, though lying not far from the circle whose diameter was the axis of Mars' orbit, joining perihelion and aphelion, always fell inside the circle except at those two points. It was a long time before it dawned upon Kepler that the simplest figure falling within the circle except at the two extremities of the diameter, was an ellipse, and it is not clear why his first attempt with an ellipse should have been just as much too narrow as the circle was too wide. The fact remains that he recognised suddenly that halving this error was tantamount to reducing the circle to the ellipse whose eccentricity was that of the old theory, i.e. that in which the sun would be in one focus and the equant in the other.\nHaving now fitted the ends of both major and minor axes of the ellipse, he leaped to the conclusion that the orbit would fit everywhere.\nThe practical effect of his clearing of the \"second inequality\" was to refer the orbit of Mars directly to the sun, and he found that the area between successive distances of Mars from the sun (instead of the sum of the distances) was strictly proportional to the time taken, in short, equal areas were described in equal times (2nd Law) when referred to the sun in the focus of the ellipse (1st Law).\n\nHe announced that (1) The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in one focus; and (2) The straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time. These are Kepler's first and second Laws though not discovered in that order, and it was at once clear that Ptolemy's \"bisection of the excentricity\" simply amounted to the fact that the centre of an ellipse bisects the distance between the foci, the sun being in one focus and the angular velocity being uniform about the empty focus. For so many centuries had the fetish of circular motion postponed discovery. It was natural that Kepler should assume that his laws would apply equally to all the planets, but the proof of this, as well as the reason underlying the laws, was only given by Newton, who approached the subject from a totally different standpoint.\n\nThis commentary on Mars was published in 1609, the year of the invention of the telescope, and Kepler petitioned the Emperor for further funds to enable him to complete the study of the other planets, but once more there was delay; in 1612 Rudolph died, and his brother Matthias who succeeded him, cared very little for astronomy or even astrology, though Kepler was reappointed to his post of Imperial Mathematician. He left Prague to take up a permanent professorship at the University of Linz. His own account of the circumstances is gloomy enough. He says, \"In the first place I could get no money from the Court, and my wife, who had for a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was taken violently ill towards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever, epilepsy and phrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three children were at once attacked with smallpox. Leopold with his army occupied the town beyond the river just as I lost the dearest of my sons, him whose nativity you will find in my book on the new star. The town on this side of the river where I lived was harassed by the Bohemian troops, whose new levies were insubordinate and insolent; to complete the whole, the Austrian army brought the plague with them into the city. I went into Austria and endeavoured to procure the situation which I now hold. Returning in June, I found my wife in a decline from her grief at the death of her son, and on the eve of an infectious fever, and I lost her also within eleven days of my return. Then came fresh annoyance, of course, and her fortune was to be divided with my step-sisters. The Emperor Rudolph would not agree to my departure; vain hopes were given me of being paid from Saxony; my time and money were wasted together, till on the death of the Emperor in 1612, I was named again by his successor, and suffered to depart to Linz.\"\n\nBeing thus left a widower with a ten-year-old daughter Susanna, and a boy Louis of half her age, he looked for a second wife to take charge of them. He has given an account of eleven ladies whose suitability he considered. The first, an intimate friend of his first wife, ultimately declined; one was too old, another an invalid, another too proud of her birth and quarterings, another could do nothing useful, and so on. Number eight kept him guessing for three months, until he tired of her constant indecision, and confided his disappointment to number nine, who was not impressed. Number ten, introduced by a friend, Kepler found exceedingly ugly and enormously fat, and number eleven apparently too young. Kepler then reconsidered one of the earlier ones, disregarding the advice of his friends who objected to her lowly station. She was the orphan daughter of a cabinetmaker, educated for twelve years by favour of the Lady of Stahrenburg, and Kepler writes of her: \"Her person and manners are suitable to mine; no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to work; she has a tolerable knowledge of how to manage a family; middle-aged and of a disposition and capability to acquire what she still wants\".\n\nWine from the Austrian vineyards was plentiful and cheap at the time of the marriage, and Kepler bought a few casks for his household. When the seller came to ascertain the quantity, Kepler noticed that no proper allowance was made for the bulging parts, and the upshot of his objections was that he wrote a book on a new method of gauging--one of the earliest specimens of modern analysis, extending the properties of plane figures to segments of cones and cylinders as being \"incorporated circles\". He was summoned before the Diet at Ratisbon to give his opinion on the Gregorian Reform of the Calendar, and soon afterwards was excommunicated, having fallen foul of the Roman Catholic party at Linz just as he had previously at Gratz, the reason apparently being that he desired to think for himself. Meanwhile his salary was not paid any more regularly than before, and he was forced to supplement it by publishing what he called a \"vile prophesying almanac which is scarcely more respectable than begging unless it be because it saves the Emperor's credit, who abandons me entirely, and with all his frequent and recent orders in council, would suffer me to perish with hunger\".\n\nIn 1617 he was invited to Italy to succeed Magini as Professor of Mathematics at Bologna. Galileo urged him to accept the post, but he excused himself on the ground that he was a German and brought up among Germans with such liberty of speech as he thought might get him into trouble in Italy. In 1619 Matthias died and was succeeded by Ferdinand III, who again retained Kepler in his post. In the same year Kepler reprinted his \"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" and also published his \"Harmonics\" in five books dedicated to James I of England. \"The first geometrical, on the origin and demonstration of the laws of the figures which produce harmonious proportions; the second, architectonical, on figurate geometry and the congruence of plane and solid regular figures; the third, properly Harmonic, on the derivation of musical proportions from figures, and on the nature and distinction of things relating to song, in opposition to the old theories; the fourth, metaphysical, psychological, and astrological, on the mental essence of Harmonics, and of their kinds in the world, especially on the harmony of rays emanating on the earth from the heavenly bodies, and on their effect in nature and on the sublunary and human soul; the fifth, astronomical and metaphysical, on the very exquisite Harmonics of the celestial motions and the origin of the excentricities in harmonious proportions.\" The extravagance of his fancies does not appear until the fourth book, in which he reiterates the statement that he was forced to adopt his astrological opinions from direct and positive observation. He despises \"The common herd of prophesiers who describe the operations of the stars as if they were a sort of deities, the lords of heaven and earth, and producing everything at their pleasure. They never trouble themselves to consider what means the stars have of working any effects among us on the earth whilst they remain in the sky and send down nothing to us which is obvious to the senses, except rays of light.\" His own notion is \"Like one who listens to a sweet melodious song, and by the gladness of his countenance, by his voice, and by the beating of his hand or foot attuned to the music, gives token that he perceives and approves the harmony: just so does sublunary nature, with the notable and evident emotion of the bowels of the earth, bear like witness to the same feelings, especially at those times when the rays of the planets form harmonious configurations on the earth,\" and again \"The earth is not an animal like a dog, ready at every nod; but more like a bull or an elephant, slow to become angry, and so much the more furious when incensed.\" He seems to have believed the earth to be actually a living animal, as witness the following: \"If anyone who has climbed the peaks of the highest mountains, throw a stone down their very deep clefts, a sound is heard from them; or if he throw it into one of the mountain lakes, which beyond doubt are bottomless, a storm will immediately arise, just as when you thrust a straw into the ear or nose of a ticklish animal, it shakes its head, or runs shudderingly away. What so like breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their mouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful tide! For although it is so regulated according to the course of the moon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have mentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon, as iron by the loadstone, yet if anyone uphold that the earth regulates its breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as animals have daily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall not think his philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if any flexible parts should be discovered in the depths of the earth, to supply the functions of lungs or gills.\"\n\nIn the same book Kepler enlarges again on his views in reference to the basis of astrology as concerned with nativities and the importance of planetary conjunctions. He gives particulars of his own nativity. \"Jupiter nearest the nonagesimal had passed by four degrees the trine of Saturn; the Sun and Venus in conjunction were moving from the latter towards the former, nearly in sextiles with both: they were also removing from quadratures with Mars, to which Mercury was closely approaching: the moon drew near to the trine of the same planet, close to the Bull's Eye even in latitude. The 25th degree of Gemini was rising, and the 22nd of Aquarius culminating. That there was this triple configuration on that day--namely the sextile of Saturn and the Sun, the sextile of Mars and Jupiter, and the quadrature of Mercury and Mars, is proved by the change of weather; for after a frost of some days, that very day became warmer, there was a thaw and a fall of rain.\" This alleged \"proof\" is interesting as it relies on the same principle which was held to justify the correction of an uncertain birth-time, by reference to illnesses, etc., met with later. Kepler however goes on to say, \"If I am to speak of the results of my studies, what, I pray, can I find in the sky, even remotely alluding to it? The learned confess that several not despicable branches of philosophy have been newly extricated or amended or brought to perfection by me: but here my constellations were, not Mercury from the East in the angle of the seventh, and in quadratures with Mars, but Copernicus, but Tycho Brahe, without whose books of observations everything now set by me in the clearest light must have remained buried in darkness; not Saturn predominating Mercury, but my lords the Emperors Rudolph and Matthias, not Capricorn the house of Saturn but Upper Austria, the house of the Emperor, and the ready and unexampled bounty of his nobles to my petition. Here is that corner, not the western one of the horoscope, but on the earth whither, by permission of my Imperial master, I have betaken myself from a too uneasy Court; and whence, during these years of my life, which now tends towards its setting, emanate these Harmonics and the other matters on which I am engaged.\"\n\nThe fifth book contains a great deal of nonsense about the harmony of the spheres; the notes contributed by the several planets are gravely set down, that of Mercury having the greatest resemblance to a melody, though perhaps more reminiscent of a bugle-call. Yet the book is not all worthless for it includes Kepler's Third Law, which he had diligently sought for years. In his own words, \"The proportion existing between the periodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate proportion of the mean distances of the orbits,\" or as generally given, \"the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances.\" Kepler was evidently transported with delight and wrote, \"What I prophesied two and twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits,--what I firmly believed long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'--what I had promised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I was sure of my discovery,--what sixteen years ago I urged as a thing to be sought,--that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical computations, at length I have brought to light, and have recognised its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations. Great as is the absolute nature of Harmonics, with all its details as set forth in my third book, it is all found among the celestial motions, not indeed in the manner which I imagined (that is not the least part of my delight), but in another very different, and yet most perfect and excellent. It is now eighteen months since I got the first glimpse of light, three months since the dawn, very few days since the unveiled sun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing holds me; I will indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt. If you forgive me, I rejoice, if you are angry, I can bear it; the die is cast, the book is written; to be read either now or by posterity, I care not which; it may well wait a century for a reader, as God has waited six thousand years for an observer.\" He gives the date 15th May, 1618, for the completion of his discovery. In his \"Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy,\" he gives his own idea as to the reason for this Third Law. \"Four causes concur for lengthening the periodic time. First, the length of the path; secondly, the weight or quantity of matter to be carried; thirdly, the degree of strength of the moving virtue; fourthly, the bulk or space into which is spread out the matter to be moved. The orbital paths of the planets are in the simple ratio of the distances; the weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the subduplicate ratio of the same distances, as has been already proved; so that with every increase of distance a planet has more matter and therefore is moved more slowly, and accumulates more time in its revolution, requiring already, as it did, more time by reason of the length of the way. The third and fourth causes compensate each other in a comparison of different planets; the simple and subduplicate proportion compound the sesquiplicate proportion, which therefore is the ratio of the periodic times.\" The only part of this \"explanation\" that is true is that the paths are in the simple ratio of the distances, the \"proof\" so confidently claimed being of the circular kind commonly known as \"begging the question\". It was reserved for Newton to establish the Laws of Motion, to find the law of force that would constrain a planet to obey Kepler's first and second Laws, and to prove that it must therefore also obey the third.",

Bryant's book on Kepler delves into the significant contributions and theories developed by Johannes Kepler, a key figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century. The chapter begins by contextualizing Kepler's work within the broader scientific discourse of his time, particularly highlighting the influence of Gilbert of Colchester's research on magnetism. Kepler, inspired by Gilbert, sought to apply the concept of magnetic attraction to celestial bodies, proposing a theory of gravitational attraction that prefigured Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n\nKepler argued against the prevailing notions of his time that denied the Earth's rotation and the gravitational attraction between celestial bodies. He posited that gravity is a mutual affection between cognate bodies, leading to the attraction of bodies towards the Earth, regardless of the Earth's position in the universe. He suggested that the Moon's gravitational pull affects the Earth's waters, causing tides, a theory that was revolutionary for its time.\n\nThe chapter then transitions to Kepler's meticulous work on the motion of Mars, which became his most notable contribution to astronomy. Kepler challenged the accuracy of existing models of Mars' orbit, which were based on the assumption of circular orbits and uniform motion. Through painstaking observation and calculation, he discovered that Mars' orbit was not a perfect circle but an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the foci. This realization led to the formulation of Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion: that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus, and that a line segment joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.\n\nKepler's work on Mars was groundbreaking, not only for its immediate implications for the understanding of planetary motion but also for its challenge to the long-held belief in the perfection of circular orbits. His dedication and methodical approach to resolving the discrepancies in Mars' observed and calculated positions underscored the importance of empirical evidence in scientific inquiry.\n\nThe chapter also touches on Kepler's personal struggles, including financial difficulties, the death of his wife and son, and his eventual move to Linz. Despite these challenges, Kepler's passion for astronomy and his commitment to understanding the universe's harmonies remained undiminished. He continued to work on the Harmonics, where he explored the mathematical relationships between planetary motions, further solidifying his legacy as a pioneer of modern astronomy.\n\nIn summary, Chapter V of Bryant's book on Kepler provides a detailed account of Kepler's revolutionary theories of planetary motion, his methodical approach to scientific research, and the personal and professional challenges he faced. Kepler's work laid the foundational principles for Newton's theory of universal gravitation and marked a significant departure from the classical understanding of the cosmos, making him a central figure in the history of astronomy.",

Kepler, who admired Gilbert's work, applied this method to his own theory, attempting to explain planetary motion through a concept akin to magnetic attraction. He described gravity as \"a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue),\" indicating that bodies are attracted to each other in a manner similar to how magnets attract iron. This description was part of his broader effort to explain the motion of celestial bodies without resorting to the conventional but flawed explanations of his time.\n\nRegarding the general idea of 'gravity' and its implications for the rotation of the earth, Kepler strongly opposed the prevailing skepticism. Critics of the rotation of the earth argued that if the earth rotated, loose objects on its surface would fly off. They also had difficulty accepting that planetary orbits could be described around an empty point in space. Kepler countered these notions by emphasizing the absurdity of their conclusions. He argued that gravity, as a mutual attraction between bodies, would prevent objects from flying off the earth's surface due to its rotation. He explained that heavy bodies are attracted to the earth not because it is the center of the world, but because it is a \"cognate round body\" with which they share a natural affinity. This stance allowed Kepler to support the idea of the earth's rotation by providing a rational explanation for why objects remain grounded, thus extending the concept of magnetic attraction to a universal principle that governed the motion of celestial bodies, including the planets.",

He clarifies, \"Heavy bodies (if we begin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the world) are not carried to the centre of the world in its quality of centre of the world, but as to the centre of a cognate round body, namely, the earth; so that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or whithersoever it may be carried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will always be carried towards it.\"\n\nKepler also theorizes about the behavior of heavy bodies in different scenarios. For example, he posits that if the Earth were not round, heavy bodies would not move towards the Earth's center from all directions but would instead tend towards different points from different sides. Additionally, he suggests that if two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other and beyond the influence of a third cognate body, they would come together at an intermediate point, each moving a distance proportional to the mass of the other, much like two magnetic needles would.\n\nThis theory of gravity and the motion of heavy bodies towards the Earth is part of Kepler's broader attempt to understand the forces governing the movements of celestial and terrestrial bodies, drawing on analogies with magnetic attraction to explain the natural tendency of bodies to move towards one another.",

In the text, it is mentioned that Kepler adopted the idea of extending the concept of magnetic attraction to the planets, influenced by Gilbert of Colchester's work on magnetism. Kepler described gravity as \"a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue),\" suggesting that the Earth attracts a stone much as it is attracted to the Earth, and by extension, that the moon and Earth attract each other.\n\nThis concept is further elaborated when Kepler theorizes about the moon's influence on Earth's tides, stating, \"The sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends as far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies rapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a flow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward.\" Here, Kepler is attributing the rise and fall of the sea tides to the gravitational pull of the moon on the Earth's waters, a concept that aligns with the modern understanding of tidal forces, albeit framed in the language and scientific understanding of his time.\n\nThus, Kepler's contributions lay in conceptualizing a mutual gravitational attraction between the moon and Earth, akin to magnetic attraction, which he applied to explain the phenomenon of the tides, marking a significant step towards the modern understanding of gravitational forces and their effects.",

His approach to solving these challenges significantly differed from that of Tycho Brahe and Longomontanus in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Use of True Oppositions**: Tycho and Longomontanus used oppositions (when Earth, Sun, and Mars align) to determine the mean motion of Mars but applied corrections to account for what they perceived as the \"second inequality,\" which is due to the orbital motion of Earth. They aimed to find a position for the \"equant\" (a point from which the planet's motion would appear uniform) that matched Tycho's observations. Kepler, however, decided to use true oppositions without applying the corrections that Tycho and Longomontanus deemed necessary. This was a fundamental shift in approach, as Kepler believed that using true oppositions would provide a more accurate basis for his calculations. He faced difficulty convincing Tycho of this method's improvement, but he undertook to demonstrate its efficacy through actual examples, showing that a false position of the orbit could fit the longitudes within a small margin of error while giving incorrect values for latitudes and second inequalities.\n\n2. **Rejection of Circular Orbits and Uniform Velocity**: Kepler's repeated calculations led him to conclude that no uniformly described circle could represent the motion of Mars. This realization was a departure from the methods of Tycho and Longomontanus, who were still working within the framework of circular orbits and uniform motion about an equant. Kepler determined that either the orbit could not be circular, or the angular velocity could not be constant about any point. This insight led him to explore non-circular orbits, eventually leading to his formulation of the laws of planetary motion.\n\n3. **Introduction of the Ellipse**: After numerous attempts and failures to fit Mars' orbit into a circular model, Kepler began to consider non-circular orbits. His breakthrough came when he realized that the orbit of Mars could be accurately described by an ellipse rather than a circle. This was a significant departure from the prevailing astronomical models of Tycho and Longomontanus, which were still anchored in the concept of circular orbits. Kepler's adoption of the ellipse allowed him to accurately account for the observed positions of Mars, leading to the formulation of his first law of planetary motion.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's approach differed from that of Tycho and Longomontanus in his use of true oppositions without corrections for the second inequality, his rejection of circular orbits and uniform motion about an equant, and his pioneering adoption of elliptical orbits to describe the motion of planets. These methodological differences enabled Kepler to overcome the challenges he faced in determining the mean motion of Mars and to make groundbreaking contributions to the field of astronomy.",

Initially, the prevailing methods, as used by Tycho and Longomontanus, involved applying corrections to the true oppositions to account for the \"second inequality,\" which we now understand as the effect of Earth's orbital motion. These methods aimed to find a constant angular motion around an \"equant\" that would align with observed positions in longitude and latitude. However, these approaches resulted in inaccuracies, particularly in the latitudes and the second inequalities.\n\nKepler, upon his arrival at Prague, was informed that the longitudes calculated by Tycho and Longomontanus were accurate within a couple of minutes of arc, but he found \"discordances ten times as great\" upon reviewing the data. This discrepancy motivated Kepler to advocate for the use of true oppositions, without the traditional corrections, to \"clear the ground of assumptions as far as possible.\" Despite Tycho's initial objections, Kepler demonstrated that adjusting the equant could make a false orbit appear to fit the longitudes within five minutes of arc while still producing erroneous values for latitudes and second inequalities.\n\nThis insistence on using true oppositions and his subsequent recalculations led Kepler to realize that the existing models could not accurately represent Mars' motion. His repeated calculations, which he performed \"no fewer than seventy times,\" and his refusal to accept inaccuracies greater than two minutes of arc pushed him to seek a new theory of planetary motion. This pursuit led him to conclude that either the orbit of Mars was not circular, or the angular velocity was not constant about any point. \n\nKepler's breakthrough came when he decided to test the hypothesis that the orbit might not be circular. By taking observed positions of Mars and attempting to fit them into different models, he eventually realized that an elliptical orbit, with the sun at one focus, provided a much more accurate representation of Mars' motion. This realization was a direct result of his determination to use true oppositions and to rigorously test and refine his hypotheses based on observed data, leading to the formulation of his first two laws of planetary motion: that planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus, and that a line segment joining a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.",

This principle, as described in the text, involves the assumption that \"the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity.\" Specifically, it suggests that the motion of a planet is uniform about a point such that the center of its orbit bisects the distance between this point and the sun. This concept was a departure from Kepler's initial reluctance to make this assumption without a clear rationale from Ptolemy, as he preferred not to adopt it, \"only taking for granted that the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity.\"\n\nThe significance of adopting this principle is highlighted by the marked improvement in the residuals of Kepler's calculations, which \"was the result of this step, proving, so far, the correctness of Ptolemy's principle.\" This improvement indicated that the principle was correct in reducing the discrepancies between the predicted and observed positions of Mars, thus enhancing the accuracy of Kepler's model. Before this adoption, Kepler faced discordances in his model, with errors in latitude and longitude that could not be reconciled through his previous methods. The principle of the bisection of the excentricity offered a simplification that allowed for a more accurate representation of planetary motion.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of this principle was a pivotal moment in Kepler's journey toward discovering his first two laws of planetary motion. It facilitated a transition from circular to elliptical orbits by indicating that the center of an ellipse bisects the distance between the foci, with the sun being in one focus. This insight was crucial for Kepler to conclude that \"the planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in one focus,\" which is Kepler's First Law. Additionally, it laid the groundwork for his Second Law, that \"The straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time.\"\n\nIn summary, Kepler's adoption of Ptolemy's principle of the bisection of the excentricity was significant because it directly contributed to the improvement in the accuracy of his model by resolving discrepancies in the predicted positions of Mars.

His journey toward the discovery of the elliptical orbit involved several key steps and realizations:\n\n1. **Rejection of Circular Orbits and Uniform Motion:** Kepler's repeated calculations and observations showed that the motion of Mars could not be accurately represented by a circle or by assuming a constant angular velocity about any point. This realization came after he \"repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times\" and found significant discordances, especially in the latitudes and longitudes at different parts of the orbit, which led him to conclude that \"no uniformly described circle could possibly represent the motion of Mars.\"\n\n2. **Investigation of the Orbital Motion:** Kepler decided to investigate the \"second inequality,\" which refers to the apparent motion caused by Earth's annual movement. He revisited an old idea that the Earth (or the sun, as he preferred) should have an equant as well as the planets, leading him to discover irregularities in the solar motion. This encouraged him to consider a force that was weaker at greater distances, which aligned with his observations of greater velocity at the nearer apse.\n\n3. **Division of the Orbit into Equal Parts:** Kepler divided the orbit into 360 equal parts and calculated the distances to these points, a method inspired by Archimedes. He found that \"the sums of successive distances from his 360 points were approximately proportional to the times from point to point,\" which allowed him to represent the annual motion of the Earth more accurately, thus affecting the perceived motion of Mars.\n\n4. **Discovery of the Elliptical Shape:** Upon trying different shapes for the orbit, including ovals and circles with adjusted parameters, Kepler observed that an ellipse with the sun at one focus provided a better fit for Mars' motion. Specifically, when he adjusted the circle to an ellipse by reducing its size in a specific ratio, he found that it fit the motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as at the apses. This was a pivotal moment, as he noted, \"Mars now appeared too slow at the apses instead of too quick, so obviously some intermediate ellipse must be sought between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same axis.\"\n\nKepler's meticulous approach, characterized by the rejection of circular orbits and uniform motion, the application of mathematical calculations to divide the orbit into equal parts, and the adjustment of the orbit's shape based on observed discrepancies, ultimately led him to the groundbreaking discovery that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.

The text describes a pivotal moment where Kepler, through diligent calculation and observation, noticed a coincidence that significantly advanced his understanding of planetary motion. This moment is described as follows: \"Half-way between the apses lay the mean distance, and at this position the error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle, amounting to .00429 of a radius... The secant of this angle was 1.00429, so that he noted that an ellipse reduced from the circle in the ratio of 1.00429 to 1 would fit the motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.\"\n\nThis discovery was not merely a lucky guess; it was the result of \"enormous labour and patience\" on Kepler's part. The text emphasizes that Kepler's genius and his \"infinite capacity for taking pains\" enabled him to sift through his hypotheses—many of which were unsound—to arrive at a groundbreaking conclusion. This process underscores the idea that while coincidence played a role in Kepler's discovery, it was his preparedness, diligence, and ability to recognize the significance of what he had found that truly mattered. As the text puts it, \"a coincidence like this only happens to somebody who 'deserves his luck,'\" which means that \"recognition is essential to the coincidence.\"\n\nKepler's own reflection on this process, as implied in the text, suggests a nuanced understanding of the role of coincidence in scientific discovery. He recognized the fortuitous nature of his findings but also knew that such moments of serendipity are only fruitful when met with a prepared mind and a willingness to pursue the implications of those findings rigorously.

This was a significant departure from the Ptolemaic system, which had dominated astronomical thought for centuries with its complex system of epicycles to explain planetary motion, and from the Copernican system, which, while correctly placing the Sun at the center of the Solar System, still maintained the idea of circular orbits.\n\nKepler's first major challenge to the idea of circular orbits and uniform motion comes from his first two laws. The first law states that \"The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in one focus,\" directly contradicting the notion of circular orbits. The second law, which states that \"The straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time,\" challenges the idea of uniform motion by showing that a planet's speed varies depending on its distance from the Sun; it moves faster when closer to the Sun and slower when farther away.\n\nKepler arrived at these conclusions after years of painstaking work analyzing the observational data of Mars collected by Tycho Brahe. His analysis revealed inconsistencies with the circular orbit model, leading him to propose the elliptical orbit model instead. This was a radical departure from the existing models and required a significant shift in thinking about the heavens.\n\nNewton's contribution to understanding Kepler's laws came from his development of the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation. Newton was able to show mathematically that Kepler's laws were a natural consequence of a force that decreased with the square of the distance between two bodies (the inverse-square law). This force, which he identified as gravity, acted between all masses in the universe and could explain not only the motion of planets but also phenomena such as tides and the trajectories of comets.\n\nNewton's work provided the theoretical framework that explained why Kepler's laws worked. His laws of motion and universal gravitation showed that elliptical orbits and the varying speed of planets in their orbits were the result of gravitational forces. This not only validated Kepler's empirical laws but also unified celestial and terrestrial physics, showing that the same physical laws applied both on Earth and in the heavens.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's laws challenged the prevailing belief in circular orbits and uniform motion by empirically demonstrating that planets move in elliptical orbits with varying speeds. Newton's contribution was to provide the theoretical underpinning for these observations, showing that they were a natural consequence of gravitational forces, thereby fundamentally changing our understanding of the universe.",

He considered the suitability of eleven ladies, evaluating their characteristics against his needs and those of his family. He sought someone with \"no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to work; she has a tolerable knowledge of how to manage a family; middle-aged and of a disposition and capability to acquire what she still wants.\" This pragmatic approach to marriage reflects how Kepler applied his analytical mindset to personal matters, seeking a partner who could effectively manage the practical aspects of his household.\n\nSecondly, Kepler's interest in gauging was sparked by a practical issue he encountered when purchasing wine. He noticed that the method used to measure the wine did not properly account for the bulging parts of the casks, leading him to develop \"a book on a new method of gauging.\" This work extended \"the properties of plane figures to segments of cones and cylinders as being 'incorporated circles'.\" This endeavor shows Kepler's inclination to apply his mathematical and analytical skills to solve practical problems, improving the accuracy of measurements that had direct implications for commerce and daily life.\n\nThese instances demonstrate that Kepler's interests and concerns extended beyond the realm of astronomy. His methodical approach to selecting a spouse and his initiative to develop a new method of gauging wine casks reflect a man deeply engaged with the practicalities of life, willing to apply his considerable intellect and skills to address everyday challenges. This blend of scientific brilliance with practical problem-solving highlights the multifaceted nature of Kepler's pursuits and interests.",

                                    "text": "Kepler's work in astronomy intersected with his views on astrology in several notable ways, and he provided specific justifications for his astrological opinions. One clear intersection is evident in his belief that celestial bodies, including stars and planets, have a direct influence on sublunary and human affairs. This belief is rooted in the notion that the universe operates in a harmonious and interconnected manner, with celestial motions and configurations affecting earthly events and individual destinies.\n\nKepler justified his astrological opinions by arguing that they were based on direct and positive observation. He criticized the common approach to astrology, which personified stars as deities with arbitrary powers, and instead proposed a more naturalistic view. He suggested that just as a person might react physically to music through movements or expressions of pleasure, so too does nature respond to the configurations of planets and stars. This analogy implies a sympathetic relationship between celestial and terrestrial phenomena, grounded in observable effects rather than mystical attributions.\n\nFurthermore, Kepler's astrological views were intertwined with his scientific observations and theories. For example, he discussed the influence of planetary conjunctions on weather patterns, using his own nativity as a case study to illustrate how celestial configurations could be linked to terrestrial events. He argued that the alignment of planets at his birth correlated with a change in weather, presenting this as evidence of the astrological principle that celestial phenomena can influence earthly conditions.\n\nKepler also believed in the living nature of the Earth, likening it to an animal that reacts to external stimuli, such as the moon's influence on tides, which he initially theorized as a form of attraction similar to magnetism. This view further demonstrates how his astronomical research and astrological beliefs were interconnected, with both resting on the premise that the universe is a dynamic and interconnected system where celestial and terrestrial realms influence each other.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's work in astronomy intersected with his views on astrology through his belief in the harmonious and influential relationship between celestial and terrestrial phenomena. He justified his astrological opinions by appealing to direct observation and naturalistic analogies, positioning astrology as a legitimate extension of his astronomical research rather than a separate or mystical practice.",

He describes his journey to this discovery as a long and arduous one, filled with anticipation and hope. He states, \"What I prophesied two and twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits,--what I firmly believed long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'--what I had promised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I was sure of my discovery,--what sixteen years ago I urged as a thing to be sought,--that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical computations, at length I have brought to light, and have recognised its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations.\" This passage reflects the culmination of years of dedication and the fulfillment of long-held beliefs and predictions.\n\nFurthermore, Kepler's metaphorical language illustrates his profound emotional engagement with his work and its significance. He likens his discovery to \"stealing the golden vases of the Egyptians to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt,\" indicating a sense of achieving something monumental and transformative, albeit through challenging conventional wisdom (\"the golden vases of the Egyptians\"). He expresses a readiness to face any criticism or backlash (\"If you forgive me, I rejoice, if you are angry, I can bear it; the die is cast, the book is written; to be read either now or by posterity, I care not which; it may well wait a century for a reader, as God has waited six thousand years for an observer.\"), showing his confidence in the value and truth of his discovery, regardless of immediate recognition or understanding from others.\n\nKepler's emotional reaction is a blend of triumph, vindication, and a profound sense of contribution to the understanding of the cosmos, encapsulating the essence of a researcher who has not only made a significant scientific breakthrough but has also fulfilled a personal and philosophical quest for knowledge.",

He concluded that these factors combine to produce the sesquiplicate proportion, which is the ratio of the periodic times. Kepler's explanation suggests that the longer the path and the greater the quantity of matter, the slower the planet moves, thus requiring more time to complete its orbit. He also mentioned that the third and fourth causes (the strength of the moving virtue and the bulk or space into which the matter is spread out) compensate each other when comparing different planets.\n\nThis rationalization by Kepler represents an early attempt to understand the forces acting on planets and their motion through space, laying the groundwork for Newton's later work on the Laws of Motion and the law of universal gravitation.",

It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo's admiration for Gilbert's work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets. The general idea of \"gravity\" opposed the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth on the ground that loose objects would fly off: moreover, the latest refinements of the old system of planetary motions necessitated their orbits being described about a mere empty point. Kepler very strongly combated these notions, pointing out the absurdity of the conclusions to which they tended, and proceeded in set terms to describe his own theory.",

Gravity is a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth attracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy bodies (if we begin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the world) are not carried to the centre of the world in its quality of centre of the world, but as to the centre of a cognate round body, namely, the earth; so that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or whithersoever it may be carried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will always be carried towards it. If the earth were not round, heavy bodies would not tend from every side in a straight line towards the centre of the earth, but to different points from different sides. If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density. If the earth should cease to attract its waters to itself all the waters of the sea would he raised and would flow to the body of the moon. The sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends as far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies rapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a flow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward. If the attractive virtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it follows with greater reason that the attractive virtue of the earth extends as far as the moon and much farther; and, in short, nothing which consists of earthly substance anyhow constituted although thrown up to any height, can ever escape the powerful operation of this attractive virtue. Nothing which consists of corporeal matter is absolutely light, but that is comparatively lighter which is rarer, either by its own nature, or by accidental heat. And it is not to be thought that light bodies are escaping to the surface of the universe while they are carried upwards, or that they are not attracted by the earth. They are attracted, but in a less degree, and so are driven outwards by the heavy bodies; which being done, they stop, and are kept by the earth in their own place. But although the attractive virtue of the earth extends upwards, as has been said, so very far, yet if any stone should be at a distance great enough to become sensible compared with the earth's diameter, it is true that on the motion of the earth such a stone would not follow altogether; its own force of resistance would be combined with the attractive force of the earth, and thus it would extricate itself in some degree from the motion of the earth.\" The above passage from the Introduction to Kepler's \"Commentaries on the Motion of Mars,\" always regarded as his most valuable work, must have been known to Newton, so that no such incident as the fall of an apple was required to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the genesis of his Theory of Universal Gravitation. Kepler's glimpse at such a theory could have been no more than a glimpse, for he went no further with it. This seems a pity, as it is far less fanciful than many of his ideas, though not free from the \"virtues\" and \"animal faculties,\" that correspond to Gilbert's \"spirits and humours\". We must, however, proceed to the subject of Mars, which was, as before noted, the first important investigation entrusted to Kepler on his arrival at Prague.",

Kepler explains that heavy bodies are drawn towards the center of the earth due to their affinity with the earth, rather than the earth's position as the center of the world. He further elaborates on how bodies would interact in the absence of gravitational forces, illustrating scenarios involving stones, the moon, and the earth's waters.

Kepler's explanation in the passage lays the groundwork for the concept of gravitational attraction, which is a key component of Newton's theory. Kepler describes gravity as a mutual affection between bodies and explains how different bodies are attracted to each other based on their mass and distance. This understanding of gravity as a force of attraction between celestial bodies aligns with Newton's later formulation of the universal law of gravitation. Therefore, the passage from Kepler's work can be seen as a precursor to Newton's Theory of Universal Gravitation, providing insights that influenced Newton's groundbreaking theory.",

                    "text": "The time taken from one opposition of Mars to the next is decidedly unequal at different parts of his orbit, so that many oppositions must be used to determine the mean motion. The ancients had noticed that what was called the \"second inequality,\" due as we now know to the orbital motion of the earth, only vanished when earth, sun, and planet were in line, i.e. at the planet's opposition; therefore they used oppositions to determine the mean motion, but deemed it necessary to apply a correction to the true opposition to reduce to mean opposition, thus sacrificing part of the advantage of using oppositions. Tycho and Longomontanus had followed this method in their calculations from Tycho's twenty years' observations. Their aim was to find a position of the \"equant,\" such that these observations would show a constant angular motion about it; and that the computed positions would agree in latitude and longitude with the actual observed positions. When Kepler arrived he was told that their longitudes agreed within a couple of minutes of arc, but that something was wrong with the latitudes. He found, however, that even in longitude their positions showed discordances ten times as great as they admitted, and so, to clear the ground of assumptions as far as possible, he determined to use true oppositions. To this Tycho objected, and Kepler had great difficulty in convincing him that the new move would be any improvement, but undertook to prove to him by actual examples that a false position of the orbit could by adjusting the equant be made to fit the longitudes within five minutes of arc, while giving quite erroneous values of the latitudes and second inequalities. To avoid the possibility of further objection he carried out this demonstration separately for each of the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Tycho. For the new method he noticed that great accuracy was required in the reduction of the observed places of Mars to the ecliptic, and for this purpose the value obtained for the parallax by Tycho's assistants fell far short of the requisite accuracy. Kepler therefore was obliged to recompute the parallax from the original observations, as also the position of the line of nodes and the inclination of the orbit. The last he found to be constant, thus corroborating his theory that the plane of the orbit passed through the sun. He repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times (and that before the invention of logarithms), and at length adopted values for the mean longitude and longitude of aphelion. He found no discordance greater than two minutes of arc in Tycho's observed longitudes in opposition, but the latitudes, and also longitudes in other parts of the orbit were much more discordant, and he found to his chagrin that four years' work was practically wasted. Before making a fresh start he looked for some simplification of the labour; and determined to adopt Ptolemy's assumption known as the principle of the bisection of the excentricity. Hitherto, since Ptolemy had given no reason for this assumption, Kepler had preferred not to make it, only taking for granted that the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity (see Figs. 1, 2).",

Kepler carried out this demonstration separately for each of the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Tycho to avoid further objections. He repeated his calculations multiple times and found that using true oppositions provided greater accuracy in determining the position of Mars, even though it required significant effort and recalculations. This approach ultimately led to a realization that previous work based on false assumptions was not as accurate, and adopting true oppositions was a more reliable method for determining the position of Mars.",

The text states, \"Before making a fresh start he looked for some simplification of the labour; and determined to adopt Ptolemy's assumption known as the principle of the bisection of the excentricity.\"",

This is evident in the text: \"He repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times... and at length adopted values for the mean longitude and longitude of aphelion... He found no discordance greater than two minutes of arc in Tycho's observed longitudes in opposition, but the latitudes, and also longitudes in other parts of the orbit were much more discordant... Kepler therefore was obliged to recompute the parallax from the original observations, as also the position of the line of nodes and the inclination of the orbit.\" Thus, the line of nodes was crucial in Kepler's efforts to refine his calculations and align observed positions with theoretical predictions.",

                    "text": "A marked improvement in residuals was the result of this step, proving, so far, the correctness of Ptolemy's principle, but there still remained discordances amounting to eight minutes of arc. Copernicus, who had no idea of the accuracy obtainable in observations, would probably have regarded such an agreement as remarkably good; but Kepler refused to admit the possibility of an error of eight minutes in any of Tycho's observations. He thereupon vowed to construct from these eight minutes a new planetary theory that should account for them all. His repeated failures had by this time convinced him that no uniformly described circle could possibly represent the motion of Mars. Either the orbit could not be circular, or else the angular velocity could not be constant about any point whatever. He determined to attack the \"second inequality,\" i.e. the optical illusion caused by the earth's annual motion, but first revived an old idea of his own that for the sake of uniformity the sun, or as he preferred to regard it, the earth, should have an equant as well as the planets. From the irregularities of the solar motion he soon found that this was the case, and that the motion was uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the centre of the earth's orbit, such that the centre bisected the distance from the sun to the \"Equant\"; this fully supported Ptolemy's principle. Clearly then the earth's linear velocity could not be constant, and Kepler was encouraged to revive another of his speculations as to a force which was weaker at greater distances. He found the velocity greater at the nearer apse, so that the time over an equal arc at either apse was proportional to the distance. He conjectured that this might prove to be true for arcs at all parts of the orbit, and to test this he divided the orbit into 360 equal parts, and calculated the distances to the points of division. Archimedes had obtained an approximation to the area of a circle by dividing it radially into a very large number of triangles, and Kepler had this device in mind. He found that the sums of successive distances from his 360 points were approximately proportional to the times from point to point, and was thus enabled to represent much more accurately the annual motion of the earth which produced the second inequality of Mars, to whose motion he now returned. Three points are sufficient to define a circle, so he took three observed positions of Mars and found a circle; he then took three other positions, but obtained a different circle, and a third set gave yet another. It thus began to appear that the orbit could not be a circle. He next tried to divide into 360 equal parts, as he had in the case of the earth, but the sums of distances failed to fit the times, and he realised that the sums of distances were not a good measure of the area of successive triangles. He noted, however, that the errors at the apses were now smaller than with a central circular orbit, and of the opposite sign, so he determined to try whether an oval orbit would fit better, following a suggestion made by Purbach in the case of Mercury, whose orbit is even more eccentric than that of Mars, though observations were too scanty to form the foundation of any theory. Kepler gave his fancy play in the choice of an oval, greater at one end than the other, endeavouring to satisfy some ideas about epicyclic motion, but could not find a satisfactory curve. He then had the fortunate idea of trying an ellipse with the same axis as his tentative oval. Mars now appeared too slow at the apses instead of too quick, so obviously some intermediate ellipse must be sought between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same axis. At this point the \"long arm of coincidence\" came into play. Half-way between the apses lay the mean distance, and at this position the error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle, amounting to .00429 of a radius. With these figures in his mind, Kepler looked up the greatest optical inequality of Mars, the angle between the straight lines from Mars to the Sun and to the centre of the circle.[3] The secant of this angle was 1.00429, so that he noted that an ellipse reduced from the circle in the ratio of 1.00429 to 1 would fit the motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.\n[Footnote 3: This is clearly a maximum at AMC in Fig. 2, when its tangent AC/CM = the eccentricity.]",

Kepler rejected the notion of uniform circular motion for Mars, considering the orbit's non-circular nature or variable angular velocity. He revisited the concept of the \"second inequality\" caused by Earth's motion and proposed the inclusion of an equant for the sun or Earth to ensure uniformity. By analyzing solar motion irregularities, Kepler confirmed the need for an equant, supporting Ptolemy's principle. Kepler then explored the idea of a force weakening with distance, observing varying velocities at different points in Mars' orbit.

He found irregularities in the solar motion and determined that the motion was uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the center of the earth's orbit, supporting Ptolemy's principle. Kepler concluded that the earth's linear velocity could not be constant and speculated about a force that was weaker at greater distances. He observed that the velocity was greater at the nearer apse and conjectured that this might hold true for arcs at all parts of the orbit. Kepler divided the orbit into 360 equal parts to test this hypothesis and found that the sums of successive distances were proportional to the times from point to point, allowing him to represent more accurately the annual motion of the earth. This led him to consider that the orbit could not be a circle and prompted him to try an oval orbit, eventually leading him to the discovery of the ellipse as a better fit for Mars' motion.",

He determined to attack the \"second inequality,\" caused by the earth's annual motion, and revived an old idea that for uniformity, the sun or the earth should have an equant as well as the planets. He found irregularities in the solar motion, leading him to realize that the motion was uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the center of the earth's orbit, supporting Ptolemy's principle. Kepler's calculations and observations led him to the realization that the orbit of Mars could not be circular, prompting him to explore other shapes such as an oval and eventually discovering that an ellipse with the same axis as his tentative oval provided a better fit for the motion of Mars.",

He observed that the errors at the apses were smaller with an oval orbit compared to a central circular orbit, and of the opposite sign. This led him to attempt an oval orbit, following a suggestion made by Purbach in the case of Mercury. However, he faced challenges in finding a satisfactory curve for Mars' orbit. Initially, he tried an oval greater at one end than the other, attempting to satisfy ideas about epicyclic motion, but could not find a curve that worked. He then tried an ellipse with the same axis as his tentative oval, but Mars appeared too slow at the apses instead of too quick. This discrepancy indicated that an intermediate ellipse between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same axis was needed to accurately represent Mars' motion. Kepler's meticulous calculations and observations eventually led him to discover that an ellipse reduced from the circle in a specific ratio would fit the motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.",

However, it was when he tried an ellipse with the same axis as his tentative oval that he made progress. By adjusting the ellipse to be an intermediate shape between the trial ellipse and a circle on the same axis, Kepler found that this new ellipse resolved the discrepancies in Mars' motion. This adjustment was based on the concept of reducing the ellipse from the circle in a specific ratio. Kepler discovered that at the mean distance between the apses, the error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle, and this ratio coincided with the greatest optical inequality of Mars. By reducing the ellipse from the circle in this specific ratio, Kepler realized that the ellipse fit the motion of Mars at both the mean distance and the apses.

This figure helps in understanding Ptolemy's idea of uniform motion in a circle and the need for adjustments to achieve this uniformity. Figure 2, on the other hand, shows a circle containing an ellipse, with line segments from points M and N meeting at point A. This figure illustrates Kepler's journey towards discovering that the orbit of Mars could not be represented by a uniformly described circle, leading him to consider elliptical orbits instead. The figures visually explain the concepts Kepler was grappling with, such as the need for adjustments in theories and the search for more accurate representations of planetary motion beyond traditional circular orbits.",

The figure illustrates how Ptolemy's theory attempted to explain the non-uniform motion in a circle by introducing the concept of an equant point (E) around which the motion should be uniform. This theory aimed to reconcile the observed planetary motions with the idea of uniform circular motion.",

The paragraph explains this concept by stating, \"Ptolemy's idea was that uniform motion in a circle must be provided, and since the motion was not uniform about the earth, A could not coincide with C; and since the motion still failed to be uniform about A or C, some point E must be found about which the motion should be uniform.\" This highlights Ptolemy's attempt to reconcile the observed motions of celestial bodies with the concept of uniform circular motion by introducing the idea of an equant point (E) around which the motion should be uniform, even if it deviated from uniformity around the earth or the center of the orbit.",

Kepler found velocities at P and Q proportional not to AP and AQ but to AQ and AP, or to EP and EQ if EC = CA (bisection of the excentricity). The velocity at M was wrong, and AM appeared too great. Kepler's first ellipse had M moved too near C. The distance AC is much exaggerated in the figure, as also is MN. AN = CP, the radius of the circle. MN should be .00429 of the radius, and MC/NC should be 1.00429. The velocity at N appeared to be proportional to EN ( = AN). Kepler concluded that Mars moved round PNQ, so that the area described about A (the sun) was equal in equal times, A being the focus of the ellipse PNQ. The angular velocity is not quite constant about E, the equant or empty focus, but the difference could hardly have been detected in Kepler's time.",

Kepler observed that velocities at points P and Q were proportional not to AP and AQ, but to AQ and AP, or to EP and EQ if EC = CA (bisection of the excentricity). He noted errors in the velocity at point M, with AM appearing too great, leading to adjustments in his ellipse. Kepler's analysis revealed that Mars moved around PNQ, ensuring that the area described about point A (the sun) was equal in equal times, with A being the focus of the ellipse PNQ. Despite slight variations in angular velocity around E (the equant or empty focus), these differences were likely imperceptible during Kepler's era.",

At each of these the date of the year would give the angle MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth), and Tycho's observation the angle MES. So the triangle could be solved except for scale, and the ratio of SE to SM would give the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed position of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE, showing the earth's inequality. Measuring from a fixed position of the earth, it would give similarly a series of positions of Mars, which, though lying not far from the circle whose diameter was the axis of Mars' orbit, joining perihelion and aphelion, always fell inside the circle except at those two points. It was a long time before it dawned upon Kepler that the simplest figure falling within the circle except at the two extremities of the diameter, was an ellipse, and it is not clear why his first attempt with an ellipse should have been just as much too narrow as the circle was too wide. The fact remains that he recognised suddenly that halving this error was tantamount to reducing the circle to the ellipse whose eccentricity was that of the old theory, i.e. that in which the sun would be in one focus and the equant in the other.\nHaving now fitted the ends of both major and minor axes of the ellipse, he leaped to the conclusion that the orbit would fit everywhere.\nThe practical effect of his clearing of the \"second inequality\" was to refer the orbit of Mars directly to the sun, and he found that the area between successive distances of Mars from the sun (instead of the sum of the distances) was strictly proportional to the time taken, in short, equal areas were described in equal times (2nd Law) when referred to the sun in the focus of the ellipse (1st Law).",

He calculated the angles between Mars, the Sun, and the Earth (MSE and MES) to solve triangles and find the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. By measuring from fixed positions of Mars and the Earth, he obtained a series of positions of Mars that fell inside a circle, except at perihelion and aphelion points. It took Kepler some time to realize that the figure fitting within the circle, except at the two extremities, was an ellipse. Kepler recognized that halving the error between the circle and the ellipse led to the correct eccentricity, where the sun is in one focus and the equant in the other. Kepler then concluded that by fitting the ends of both major and minor axes of the ellipse, the orbit would fit everywhere. This process allowed Kepler to refer the orbit of Mars directly to the sun and establish that equal areas were described in equal times, which led to his first and second laws of planetary motion.",

By plotting different positions of the earth corresponding to successive rotations of Mars, Kepler was able to establish the relationship between the angles MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth) and MES. This allowed him to solve the triangle formed by these angles, and the ratio of SE to SM provided the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. This method of measurement, whether from a fixed position of Mars or the earth, led to a series of positions of Mars that fell inside the circle representing Mars' orbit. It took Kepler some time to realize that the best geometric shape fitting these positions, except at the two extremities of the diameter, was an ellipse. Kepler's adjustment to the ellipse, halving the error, aligned the orbit with the ellipse, confirming that equal areas were described in equal times when referred to the sun in the focus of the ellipse. This conclusion was a significant step in Kepler's establishment of his laws of planetary motion.",

By measuring these angles and positions, Kepler could solve a triangle to determine the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. This method allowed him to measure the variation of SE, showing the earth's inequality, and to determine a series of positions of Mars that fell inside an ellipse, which he eventually recognized as the correct shape for Mars' orbit. This process led him to conclude that the orbit would fit everywhere based on his calculations.",

Subsequently, Kepler realized that equal areas were described in equal times as Mars orbited the sun, leading to his second law. It was noted that Ptolemy's concept of the \"bisection of the excentricity\" was essentially a simplified version of Kepler's discovery that the center of an ellipse bisects the distance between the foci.

This law states that \"The straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in any two equal intervals of time.\" This law was crucial in revolutionizing the understanding of planetary motion as it indicated that planets do not move at a constant speed along their orbits but instead vary their speed in a way that ensures equal areas are covered in equal time intervals.\n\nThis concept was a breakthrough because it helped to explain the varying speeds of planets in their orbits, contrary to the previous belief in uniform circular motion. By observing that equal areas are swept out in equal time intervals, Kepler was able to deduce that planets move faster when closer to the sun (at perihelion) and slower when farther away (at aphelion). This insight was a fundamental departure from the traditional geocentric model and paved the way for a more accurate description of planetary motion.\n\nKepler's second Law, along with his first Law stating that \"The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in one focus,\" laid the foundation for a new understanding of celestial mechanics. It marked a significant departure from the circular orbits of the past and provided a more accurate description of how planets move in space. As the text mentions, these laws were not discovered in that order, but their combined effect was groundbreaking in reshaping astronomical thought.",

The text states, \"For so many centuries had the fetish of circular motion postponed discovery.\" This indicates that the longstanding belief and preference for circular motion in explaining planetary orbits hindered the realization of Kepler's revolutionary laws. Kepler's laws, which described planetary motion as following elliptical paths and sweeping out equal areas in equal times, were a departure from the traditional circular motion model. The text suggests that it was natural for Kepler to assume his laws would apply to all planets, but it was only later, with Newton, that the proof and deeper understanding of these laws were provided from a different perspective.",

The text states, \"It was at once clear that Ptolemy's 'bisection of the excentricity' simply amounted to the fact that the centre of an ellipse bisects the distance between the foci, the sun being in one focus and the angular velocity being uniform about the empty focus... It was natural that Kepler should assume that his laws would apply equally to all the planets, but the proof of this, as well as the reason underlying the laws, was only given by Newton, who approached the subject from a totally different standpoint.\" This shows that Newton's contribution involved not only extending Kepler's laws to all planets but also providing the proof and reasoning behind them, which Kepler had not fully explored.",

He left Prague to take up a permanent professorship at the University of Linz. His own account of the circumstances is gloomy enough. He says, \"In the first place I could get no money from the Court, and my wife, who had for a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was taken violently ill towards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever, epilepsy and phrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three children were at once attacked with smallpox. Leopold with his army occupied the town beyond the river just as I lost the dearest of my sons, him whose nativity you will find in my book on the new star. The town on this side of the river where I lived was harassed by the Bohemian troops, whose new levies were insubordinate and insolent; to complete the whole, the Austrian army brought the plague with them into the city. I went into Austria and endeavoured to procure the situation which I now hold. Returning in June, I found my wife in a decline from her grief at the death of her son, and on the eve of an infectious fever, and I lost her also within eleven days of my return. Then came fresh annoyance, of course, and her fortune was to be divided with my step-sisters. The Emperor Rudolph would not agree to my departure; vain hopes were given me of being paid from Saxony; my time and money were wasted together, till on the death of the Emperor in 1612, I was named again by his successor, and suffered to depart to Linz.\"",

His wife's illness, his children falling ill with smallpox, the death of his son, and the subsequent death of his wife caused him immense grief and hardship. These personal tragedies affected his ability to focus on his work and led to him seeking a more stable position. Kepler described his difficult circumstances, stating, \"my wife, who had for a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was taken violently ill... She was scarcely convalescent when all my three children were at once attacked with smallpox... I lost the dearest of my sons... I found my wife in a decline from her grief at the death of her son, and on the eve of an infectious fever, and I lost her also within eleven days of my return.\" These losses, combined with financial struggles and political turmoil, pushed Kepler to seek a new position at the University of Linz, away from the challenges he faced in Prague. Despite facing numerous obstacles and personal tragedies, Kepler persevered in his professional pursuits, eventually being reappointed to his position as Imperial Mathematician and being allowed to depart to Linz after the death of Emperor Rudolph in 1612.",

The text reveals that Kepler faced immense personal hardships, including the illness and loss of his wife and children, as well as political turmoil and financial struggles. These experiences shaped his future endeavors in several ways:\n\n1. **Emotional Turmoil Impacting Work:** Kepler's personal losses, such as the death of his wife and children, and the challenges he faced due to the political and health crises, deeply affected him emotionally. This emotional turmoil likely influenced his work and focus, as indicated by his own gloomy account of the circumstances: \"He says, 'In the first place I could get no money from the Court...'\" This emotional strain could have fueled his determination to succeed despite the adversities he faced.\n\n2. **Professional Resilience:** Despite the hardships he endured, Kepler displayed resilience in his professional pursuits. He continued to seek opportunities to advance his astronomical studies, petitioning for funds and eventually securing a professorship at the University of Linz. This resilience in the face of personal and professional setbacks showcases Kepler's determination and commitment to his work.\n\n3. **Impact on Research:** Kepler's challenging experiences likely influenced the direction of his research and the depth of his contributions to astronomy. The text mentions that he was reappointed as the Imperial Mathematician and later moved to a professorship, indicating that he continued his astronomical studies despite the difficulties he faced. These experiences may have fueled his passion for understanding the cosmos and could have influenced the innovative approaches he later applied to his astronomical observations and theories.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's personal hardships during this period, including personal losses, financial struggles, and political turmoil, played a significant role in shaping his future work and contributions to astronomy by influencing his emotional state, fostering professional resilience, and potentially impacting the direction and depth of his research efforts.",

Kepler's wife and children fell ill with smallpox and other ailments, leading to a series of unfortunate events. His wife's illness, followed by the death of his son, caused immense grief and hardship for Kepler. This was compounded by the challenging circumstances in the town where he lived, including military occupation, insubordinate troops, and the outbreak of the plague. Kepler described the situation as follows: \"In the first place I could get no money from the Court, and my wife, who had for a long time been suffering from low spirits and despondency, was taken violently ill towards the end of 1610, with the Hungarian fever, epilepsy and phrenitis. She was scarcely convalescent when all my three children were at once attacked with smallpox. Leopold with his army occupied the town beyond the river just as I lost the dearest of my sons... The town on this side of the river where I lived was harassed by the Bohemian troops, whose new levies were insubordinate and insolent; to complete the whole, the Austrian army brought the plague with them into the city.\"\n\nThese personal tragedies not only brought immense sorrow to Kepler but also affected his professional endeavors. The difficult circumstances, combined with the lack of support from the Court and the need to care for his family, hindered Kepler's ability to focus on his astronomical studies. Kepler mentioned that he wasted time and money, faced vain hopes of payment from Saxony, and struggled with the division of his wife's fortune with his step-sisters. Despite these challenges, Kepler was eventually able to continue his work in astronomy after being named again by Rudolph's successor and allowed to depart to Linz: \"I was named again by his successor, and suffered to depart to Linz.\"",

Number eight kept him guessing for three months, until he tired of her constant indecision, and confided his disappointment to number nine, who was not impressed. Number ten, introduced by a friend, Kepler found exceedingly ugly and enormously fat, and number eleven apparently too young. Kepler then reconsidered one of the earlier ones, disregarding the advice of his friends who objected to her lowly station. She was the orphan daughter of a cabinetmaker, educated for twelve years by favour of the Lady of Stahrenburg, and Kepler writes of her: \"Her person and manners are suitable to mine; no pride, no extravagance; she can bear to work; she has a tolerable knowledge of how to manage a family; middle-aged and of a disposition and capability to acquire what she still wants\".",

Galileo urged him to accept the post, but he excused himself on the ground that he was a German and brought up among Germans with such liberty of speech as he thought might get him into trouble in Italy. In 1619 Matthias died and was succeeded by Ferdinand III, who again retained Kepler in his post. In the same year Kepler reprinted his \"Mysterium Cosmographicum,\" and also published his \"Harmonics\" in five books dedicated to James I of England. \"The first geometrical, on the origin and demonstration of the laws of the figures which produce harmonious proportions; the second, architectonical, on figurate geometry and the congruence of plane and solid regular figures; the third, properly Harmonic, on the derivation of musical proportions from figures, and on the nature and distinction of things relating to song, in opposition to the old theories; the fourth, metaphysical, psychological, and astrological, on the mental essence of Harmonics, and of their kinds in the world, especially on the harmony of rays emanating on the earth from the heavenly bodies, and on their effect in nature and on the sublunary and human soul; the fifth, astronomical and metaphysical, on the very exquisite Harmonics of the celestial motions and the origin of the excentricities in harmonious proportions.\" The extravagance of his fancies does not appear until the fourth book, in which he reiterates the statement that he was forced to adopt his astrological opinions from direct and positive observation. He despises \"The common herd of prophesiers who describe the operations of the stars as if they were a sort of deities, the lords of heaven and earth, and producing everything at their pleasure. They never trouble themselves to consider what means the stars have of working any effects among us on the earth whilst they remain in the sky and send down nothing to us which is obvious to the senses, except rays of light.\" His own notion is \"Like one who listens to a sweet melodious song, and by the gladness of his countenance, by his voice, and by the beating of his hand or foot attuned to the music, gives token that he perceives and approves the harmony: just so does sublunary nature, with the notable and evident emotion of the bowels of the earth, bear like witness to the same feelings, especially at those times when the rays of the planets form harmonious configurations on the earth,\" and again \"The earth is not an animal like a dog, ready at every nod; but more like a bull or an elephant, slow to become angry, and so much the more furious when incensed.\" He seems to have believed the earth to be actually a living animal, as witness the following: \"If anyone who has climbed the peaks of the highest mountains, throw a stone down their very deep clefts, a sound is heard from them; or if he throw it into one of the mountain lakes, which beyond doubt are bottomless, a storm will immediately arise, just as when you thrust a straw into the ear or nose of a ticklish animal, it shakes its head, or runs shudderingly away. What so like breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their mouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful tide! For although it is so regulated according to the course of the moon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have mentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon, as iron by the loadstone, yet if anyone uphold that the earth regulates its breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as animals have daily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall not think his philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if any flexible parts should be discovered in the depths of the earth, to supply the functions of lungs or gills.\"",

Kepler criticizes the common prophesiers for describing the stars as if they were \"lords of heaven and earth\" who \"producing everything at their pleasure\" without considering how they actually affect events on Earth. Kepler's approach to astrology is more nuanced and based on observation. He believes that the harmony of the celestial bodies influences nature in a more subtle way, comparing it to a person appreciating music and reacting to it. Kepler's view is that the effects of celestial bodies are more about harmony and influence rather than direct control. He states, \"They never trouble themselves to consider what means the stars have of working any effects among us on the earth whilst they remain in the sky and send down nothing to us which is obvious to the senses, except rays of light.\" This contrasts with the common prophesiers' belief in the direct and powerful influence of the stars and planets on earthly events.",

Kepler explored the origin and demonstration of laws of figures producing harmonious proportions, the derivation of musical proportions from figures, and the harmony of celestial motions. The book also delved into Kepler's astrological opinions, where he claimed to have adopted them from direct observation. Despite the extravagance of some of his ideas in the fourth book, Kepler's 'Harmonics' provided insights into the connections between harmonious proportions, celestial motions, and the effects of heavenly bodies on nature and the human soul.",

Kepler's musings on these phenomena led him to speculate about the earth's behavior, considering the possibility of the earth having flexible parts akin to lungs or gills, which could regulate its breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon. This is evident in the following passage: \"For although it is so regulated according to the course of the moon, that, in the preface to my 'Commentaries on Mars,' I have mentioned it as probable that the waters are attracted by the moon, as iron by the loadstone, yet if anyone uphold that the earth regulates its breathing according to the motion of the sun and moon, as animals have daily and nightly alternations of sleep and waking, I shall not think his philosophy unworthy of being listened to; especially if any flexible parts should be discovered in the depths of the earth, to supply the functions of lungs or gills.\"",

This is evident in the paragraph where Kepler states, \"What so like breathing, especially of those fish who draw water into their mouths and spout it out again through their gills, as that wonderful tide!\" This shows how Kepler's observations of natural phenomena led him to anthropomorphize the earth and attribute animal-like behaviors to it.",

He gives particulars of his own nativity. \"Jupiter nearest the nonagesimal had passed by four degrees the trine of Saturn; the Sun and Venus in conjunction were moving from the latter towards the former, nearly in sextiles with both: they were also removing from quadratures with Mars, to which Mercury was closely approaching: the moon drew near to the trine of the same planet, close to the Bull's Eye even in latitude. The 25th degree of Gemini was rising, and the 22nd of Aquarius culminating. That there was this triple configuration on that day--namely the sextile of Saturn and the Sun, the sextile of Mars and Jupiter, and the quadrature of Mercury and Mars, is proved by the change of weather; for after a frost of some days, that very day became warmer, there was a thaw and a fall of rain.\" This alleged \"proof\" is interesting as it relies on the same principle which was held to justify the correction of an uncertain birth-time, by reference to illnesses, etc., met with later. Kepler however goes on to say, \"If I am to speak of the results of my studies, what, I pray, can I find in the sky, even remotely alluding to it? The learned confess that several not despicable branches of philosophy have been newly extricated or amended or brought to perfection by me: but here my constellations were, not Mercury from the East in the angle of the seventh, and in quadratures with Mars, but Copernicus, but Tycho Brahe, without whose books of observations everything now set by me in the clearest light must have remained buried in darkness; not Saturn predominating Mercury, but my lords the Emperors Rudolph and Matthias, not Capricorn the house of Saturn but Upper Austria, the house of the Emperor, and the ready and unexampled bounty of his nobles to my petition. Here is that corner, not the western one of the horoscope, but on the earth whither, by permission of my Imperial master, I have betaken myself from a too uneasy Court; and whence, during these years of my life, which now tends towards its setting, emanate these Harmonics and the other matters on which I am engaged.\"",

Yet the book is not all worthless for it includes Kepler's Third Law, which he had diligently sought for years. In his own words, \"The proportion existing between the periodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate proportion of the mean distances of the orbits,\" or as generally given, \"the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances.\" Kepler was evidently transported with delight and wrote, \"What I prophesied two and twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered the five solids among the heavenly orbits,--what I firmly believed long before I had seen Ptolemy's 'Harmonics'--what I had promised my friends in the title of this book, which I named before I was sure of my discovery,--what sixteen years ago I urged as a thing to be sought,--that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical computations, at length I have brought to light, and have recognised its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations. Great as is the absolute nature of Harmonics, with all its details as set forth in my third book, it is all found among the celestial motions, not indeed in the manner which I imagined (that is not the least part of my delight), but in another very different, and yet most perfect and excellent. It is now eighteen months since I got the first glimpse of light, three months since the dawn, very few days since the unveiled sun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing holds me; I will indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt. If you forgive me, I rejoice, if you are angry, I can bear it; the die is cast, the book is written; to be read either now or by posterity, I care not which; it may well wait a century for a reader, as God has waited six thousand years for an observer.\" He gives the date 15th May, 1618, for the completion of his discovery. In his \"Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy,\" he gives his own idea as to the reason for this Third Law. \"Four causes concur for lengthening the periodic time. First, the length of the path; secondly, the weight or quantity of matter to be carried; thirdly, the degree of strength of the moving virtue; fourthly, the bulk or space into which is spread out the matter to be moved. The orbital paths of the planets are in the simple ratio of the distances; the weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the subduplicate ratio of the same distances, as has been already proved; so that with every increase of distance a planet has more matter and therefore is moved more slowly, and accumulates more time in its revolution, requiring already, as it did, more time by reason of the length of the way. The third and fourth causes compensate each other in a comparison of different planets; the simple and subduplicate proportion compound the sesquiplicate proportion, which therefore is the ratio of the periodic times.\" The only part of this \"explanation\" that is true is that the paths are in the simple ratio of the distances, the \"proof\" so confidently claimed being of the circular kind commonly known as \"begging the question\". It was reserved for Newton to establish the Laws of Motion, to find the law of force that would constrain a planet to obey Kepler's first and second Laws, and to prove that it must therefore also obey the third.",

Kepler's Third Law states, \"The proportion existing between the periodic times of any two planets is exactly the sesquiplicate proportion of the mean distances of the orbits,\" or more commonly expressed as, \"the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances.\" This law was a significant breakthrough in understanding the motion of planets.\n\nKepler's explanation of the Third Law highlighted the factors that influence the length of the periodic time of a planet, such as the length of the path, the weight or quantity of matter to be carried, the strength of the moving virtue, and the space into which the matter is spread out. He demonstrated how these factors interact to determine the orbital paths of planets and their speeds of motion.\n\nWhile some aspects of Kepler's explanation were not entirely accurate, such as the claim that the weights or quantities of matter in different planets are in the subduplicate ratio of the distances, his overall contribution laid the groundwork for Newton's later discoveries. Newton built upon Kepler's laws and went on to establish the Laws of Motion and the law of force that govern planetary motion, showing how Kepler's laws fit into a broader framework of physical laws.\n\nIn summary, Kepler's elucidation of the Third Law, despite its shortcomings, provided a crucial link in understanding the relationships between planetary motion and celestial mechanics, setting the stage for Newton to develop a comprehensive theory of gravitation and motion.",

            "text": "Soon after its publication Kepler's \"Epitome\" was placed along with the book of Copernicus, on the list of books prohibited by the Congregation of the Index at Rome, and he feared that this might prevent the publication or sale of his books in Austria also, but was told that though Galileo's violence was getting him into trouble, there would be no difficulty in obtaining permission for learned men to read any prohibited books, and that he (Kepler) need fear nothing so long as he remained quiet.\n\nIn his various works on Comets, he adhered to the opinion that they travelled in straight lines with varying velocity. He suggested that comets come from the remotest parts of ether, as whales and monsters from the depth of the sea, and that perhaps they are something of the nature of silkworms, and are wasted and consumed in spinning their own tails. Napier's invention of logarithms at once attracted Kepler's attention. He must have regretted that the discovery was not made early enough to save him a vast amount of labour in computations, but he managed to find time to compute some logarithm tables for himself, though he does not seem to have understood quite what Napier had done, and though with his usual honesty he gave full credit to the Scottish baron for his invention.\n\nThough Eugenists may find a difficulty in reconciling Napier's brilliancy with the extreme youth of his parents, they may at any rate attribute Kepler's occasional fits of bad temper to heredity. His cantankerous mother, Catherine Kepler, had for some years been carrying on an action for slander against a woman who had accused her of administering a poisonous potion. Dame Kepler employed a young advocate who for reasons of his own \"nursed\" the case so long that after five years had elapsed without any conclusion being reached another judge was appointed, who had himself suffered from the caustic tongue of the prosecutrix, and so was already prejudiced against her. The defendant, knowing this, turned the tables on her opponent by bringing an accusation of witchcraft against her, and Catherine Kepler was imprisoned and condemned to the torture in July, 1620. Kepler, hearing of the sentence, hurried back from Linz, and succeeded in stopping the completion of the sentence, securing his mother's release the following year, as it was made clear that the only support for the case against her was her own intemperate language. Kepler returned to Linz, and his mother at once brought another action for costs and damages against her late opponent, but died before the case could be tried.\nA few months before this Sir Henry Wotton, English Ambassador to Venice, visited Kepler, and finding him as usual, almost penniless, urged him to go to England, promising him a warm welcome there. Kepler, however, would not at that time leave Germany, giving several reasons, one of which was that he dreaded the confinement of an island. Later on he expressed his willingness to go as soon as his Rudolphine Tables were published, and lecture on them, even in England, if he could not do it in Germany, and if a good enough salary were forthcoming.\n\nIn 1624 he went to Vienna, and managed to extract from the Treasury 6000 florins on account of expenses connected with the Tables, but, instead of a further grant, was given letters to the States of Swabia, which owed money to the Imperial treasury. Some of this he succeeded in collecting, but the Tables were still further delayed by the religious disturbances then becoming violent. The Jesuits contrived to have Kepler's library sealed up, and, but for the Imperial protection, would have imprisoned him also; moreover the peasants revolted and blockaded Linz. In 1627, however, the long promised Tables, the first to discard the conventional circular motion, were at last published at Ulm in four parts. Two of these parts consisted of subsidiary Tables, of logarithms and other computing devices, another contained Tables of the elements of the sun, moon, and planets, and the fourth gave the places of a thousand stars as determined by Tycho, with Tycho's refraction Tables, which had the peculiarity of using different values for the refraction of the sun, moon, and stars. From a map prefixed to some copies of the Tables, we may infer that Kepler was one of the first, if not actually the first, to suggest the method of determining differences of longitude by occultations of stars at the moon's limb. In an Appendix, he showed how his Tables could be used by astrologers for their predictions, saying \"Astronomy is the daughter of Astrology, and this modern Astrology again is the daughter of Astronomy, bearing something of the lineaments of her grandmother; and, as I have already said, this foolish daughter, Astrology, supports her wise but needy mother, Astronomy, from the profits of a profession not generally considered creditable\". There is no doubt that Kepler strongly resented having to depend so much for his income on such methods which he certainly did not consider creditable.\n\nIt was probably Galileo whose praise of the new Tables induced the Grand Duke of Tuscany to send Kepler a gold chain soon after their publication, and we may perhaps regard it as a mark of favour from the Emperor Ferdinand that he permitted Kepler to attach himself to the great Wallenstein, now Duke of Friedland, and a firm believer in Astrology. The Duke was a better paymaster than either of the three successive Emperors. He furnished Kepler with an assistant and a printing press; and obtained for him the Professorship of Astronomy at the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg. Apparently, however, the Emperor could not induce Wallenstein to take over the responsibility of the 8000 crowns, still owing from the Imperial treasury on account of the Rudolphine Tables. Kepler made a last attempt to secure payment at Ratisbon, but his journey thither brought disappointment and fatigue and left him in such a condition that he rapidly succumbed to an attack of fever, dying in November, 1630, in his fifty-ninth year. His body was buried at Ratisbon, but the tombstone was destroyed during the war then raging. His daughter, Susanna, the wife of Jacob Bartsch, a physician who had helped Kepler with his Ephemeris, lost her husband soon after her father's death, and succeeded in obtaining part of Kepler's arrears of salary by threatening to keep Tycho's manuscripts, but her stepmother was left almost penniless with five young children. For their benefit Louis Kepler printed a \"Dream of Lunar Astronomy,\" which first his father and then his brother-in-law had been preparing for publication at the time of their respective deaths. It is a curious mixture of saga and fairy tale with a little science in the way of astronomy studied from the moon, and cast in the form of a dream to overcome the practical difficulties of the hypothesis of visiting the moon. Other writings in large numbers were left unpublished. No attempt at a complete edition of Kepler's works was made for a long time. One was projected in 1714 by his biographer, Hantsch, but all that appeared was one volume of letters. After various learned bodies had declined to move in the matter the manuscripts were purchased for the Imperial Russian library. An edition was at length brought out at Frankfort by C. Frisch, in eight volumes, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870.\n\nKepler's fame does not rest upon his voluminous works. With his peculiar method of approaching problems there was bound to be an inordinate amount of chaff mixed with the grain, and he used no winnowing machine. His simplicity and transparent honesty induced him to include everything, in fact he seemed to glory in the number of false trails he laboriously followed. He was one who might be expected to find the proverbial \"needle in a haystack,\" but unfortunately the needle was not always there. Delambre says, \"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish himself by his discoveries he attempted everything, and having once obtained a glimpse of one, no labour was too hard for him in following or verifying it. All his attempts had not the same success, and in fact that was impossible. Those which have failed seem to us only fanciful; those which have been more fortunate appear sublime. When in search of that which really existed, he has sometimes found it; when he devoted himself to the pursuit of a chimera, he could not but fail, but even then he unfolded the same qualities, and that obstinate perseverance that must triumph over all difficulties but those which are insurmountable.\" Berry, in his \"Short History of Astronomy,\" says \"as one reads chapter after chapter without a lucid, still less a correct idea, it is impossible to refrain from regrets that the intelligence of Kepler should have been so wasted, and it is difficult not to suspect at times that some of the valuable results which lie embedded in this great mass of tedious speculation were arrived at by a mere accident. On the other hand it must not be forgotten that such accidents have a habit of happening only to great men, and that if Kepler loved to give reins to his imagination he was equally impressed with the necessity of scrupulously comparing speculative results with observed facts, and of surrendering without demur the most beloved of his fancies if it was unable to stand this test. If Kepler had burnt three-quarters of what he printed, we should in all probability have formed a higher opinion of his intellectual grasp and sobriety of judgment, but we should have lost to a great extent the impression of extraordinary enthusiasm and industry, and of almost unequalled intellectual honesty which we now get from a study of his works.\"\n\nProfessor Forbes is more enthusiastic. In his \"History of Astronomy,\" he refers to Kepler as \"the man whose place, as is generally agreed, would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge,\" and again _à propos_ of Kepler's great book, \"it must be obvious that he had at that time some inkling of the meaning of his laws--universal gravitation. From that moment the idea of universal gravitation was in the air, and hints and guesses were thrown out by many; and in time the law of gravitation would doubtless have been discovered, though probably not by the work of one man, even if Newton had not lived. But, if Kepler had not lived, who else could have discovered his Laws?\"",

                            "text": "Chapter VI of Walter W. Bryant's book on Kepler delves into the multifaceted aspects of Johannes Kepler's life and work, illustrating his significant contributions to astronomy amidst personal and societal challenges. The chapter begins by noting the prohibition of Kepler's \"Epitome\" by the Congregation of the Index at Rome, a fate it shared with Copernicus's work, due to the contentious climate of the time, particularly surrounding Galileo's confrontations with the Church. Despite these challenges, Kepler was reassured that his scholarly pursuits would not be hindered as long as he remained discreet.\n\nKepler's intellectual curiosity led him to explore the nature of comets, proposing they traveled in straight lines with variable velocities and originated from the distant ether, akin to sea monsters emerging from the ocean depths. His engagement with Napier's invention of logarithms highlights his continual quest for knowledge and improvement in astronomical computations, despite the regret that such a tool had not been available to ease his earlier labors.\n\nThe chapter also touches on Kepler's personal life, particularly the harrowing ordeal of his mother, Catherine Kepler, who was accused of witchcraft and narrowly escaped execution through Kepler's intervention. This episode underscores the tumultuous times in which Kepler lived and the personal trials he faced.\n\nKepler's reluctance to leave Germany for England, despite financial struggles and an invitation from Sir Henry Wotton, reflects his deep connection to his homeland and his dedication to completing his Rudolphine Tables. His eventual journey to Vienna and the subsequent challenges in securing funds for his work illustrate the ongoing struggle for recognition and support that Kepler faced from the imperial treasury and other sources.\n\nThe publication of the Rudolphine Tables in 1627 marked a significant achievement for Kepler, introducing new methods for calculating celestial motions and contributing to the advancement of astronomy. However, his reliance on astrology for income, despite his personal reservations, highlights the complex relationship between scientific discovery and societal beliefs at the time.\n\nKepler's later years were marked by continued financial difficulties and the eventual patronage of the Duke of Wallenstein, which provided some stability. Yet, the burden of unpaid debts for the Rudolphine Tables and Kepler's untimely death in 1630 left his family in precarious circumstances.\n\nThe chapter concludes by reflecting on Kepler's legacy, emphasizing that despite the vast quantity of work he produced, not all of which was successful, his enduring contributions to astronomy, particularly his laws of planetary motion, underscore his significance in the history of science. His relentless pursuit of knowledge, coupled with his intellectual honesty and perseverance, cements his place among the great astronomers, whose discoveries laid the groundwork for future advancements in understanding the universe.\n\nWalter W. Bryant's portrayal of Kepler offers a comprehensive look at the astronomer's life, work, and enduring impact on the field of astronomy, presenting a nuanced picture of a man who navigated personal and professional challenges to contribute fundamentally to our understanding of the cosmos.",

The text does not specify the exact reason why the \"Epitome\" was banned, but it hints at the contentious atmosphere by mentioning that \"Galileo's violence was getting him into trouble,\" suggesting that the Church was actively suppressing works that it perceived as challenging its authority or contradicting its teachings. This action by the Congregation of the Index likely reflected the Church's broader stance against heliocentric theories and other scientific ideas that were emerging at the time.\n\nAs for the effect on Kepler's perception of his work's publication prospects in Austria, the text indicates that Kepler was initially concerned that the prohibition might \"prevent the publication or sale of his books in Austria also.\" However, he was reassured that \"there would be no difficulty in obtaining permission for learned men to read any prohibited books,\" and that he need not fear as long as he remained quiet. This reassurance suggests that while the ban was a significant obstacle, there were still avenues for the dissemination of his work among scholarly circles, albeit with certain restrictions. Kepler's concern and the subsequent reassurance he received highlight the tension between the pursuit of scientific knowledge and the constraints imposed by religious authorities during this period.",

The text mentions that \"Napier's invention of logarithms at once attracted Kepler's attention.\" It implies a regret on Kepler's part that such a tool was not available earlier to alleviate \"a vast amount of labour in computations.\" Despite not fully grasping Napier's methods initially, Kepler's engagement with the invention is evident as he \"managed to find time to compute some logarithm tables for himself.\" Furthermore, he acknowledged Napier's contribution with his \"usual honesty,\" giving \"full credit to the Scottish baron for his invention.\"\n\nIn summary, Kepler viewed comets as celestial bodies traveling in straight lines with variable speeds, likening them to natural wonders and suggesting a poetic, albeit speculative, nature to their existence. His relation to Napier's logarithms shows an eagerness to embrace new mathematical tools to ease the computational demands of his astronomical work, even if he did not completely understand them at first. This reflects Kepler's openness to innovation and his recognition of the contributions of others to the field of astronomy.",

The text describes a particularly distressing period when Kepler's mother, Catherine Kepler, was accused of witchcraft, imprisoned, and condemned to torture. This situation demanded Kepler's immediate and personal intervention: \"Kepler, hearing of the sentence, hurried back from Linz, and succeeded in stopping the completion of the sentence, securing his mother's release the following year.\" This episode illustrates Kepler's deep sense of responsibility and loyalty to his family, as he took decisive action to protect his mother, despite the personal and professional risks involved.\n\nMoreover, the ordeal with his mother's legal troubles showcases the emotional and possibly financial strain on Kepler, adding another layer of complexity to his life. The text mentions that \"his mother at once brought another action for costs and damages against her late opponent, but died before the case could be tried,\" indicating ongoing legal and emotional turmoil within his family. This situation likely added to the myriad of challenges Kepler faced, including financial instability and professional obstacles.\n\nThese personal challenges are set against the backdrop of Kepler's scientific endeavors and the broader socio-political context of the time, including religious and political upheaval. The text notes that \"the Tables were still further delayed by the religious disturbances then becoming violent,\" and \"the Jesuits contrived to have Kepler's library sealed up,\" highlighting the external pressures and challenges Kepler faced in addition to his personal and family issues.\n\nIn summary, the legal troubles of Kepler's mother reflect on his character as a dedicated and resilient individual, who, despite facing significant personal, financial, and professional challenges, remained committed to his family and his scientific work. His ability to navigate these difficulties and continue his contributions to astronomy and mathematics underscores the complexity of his character and the breadth of challenges he overcame beyond his scientific endeavors.",

                                    "text": "In Vienna, Kepler encountered significant difficulties related to the publication of his Rudolphine Tables, primarily due to religious and political disturbances. The text outlines several challenges that Kepler faced during this period:\n\n1. **Financial Struggles**: Initially, Kepler managed to extract from the Treasury 6000 florins on account of expenses connected with the Tables. However, instead of receiving a further grant as he might have hoped, he was given letters to the States of Swabia, which owed money to the Imperial treasury. Some of this he succeeded in collecting, but it was a clear indication of the financial hurdles he had to overcome to support his work.\n\n2. **Religious Disturbances**: The religious disturbances of the time played a significant role in delaying the publication of the Tables. The text mentions that \"the Tables were still further delayed by the religious disturbances then becoming violent.\" This indicates that the socio-political climate, heavily influenced by religious tensions, was not conducive to the smooth progress of scientific work.\n\n3. **Interference by the Jesuits**: The Jesuits, representing a powerful religious group within the Catholic Church, directly interfered with Kepler's work by having his library sealed up. This act would have deprived Kepler of access to his own research materials and books, significantly hindering his ability to work on the Tables or any other scientific endeavors.\n\n4. **Imperial Protection Against Imprisonment**: The text notes that \"but for the Imperial protection, [the Jesuits] would have imprisoned him also.\" This implies that Kepler was under threat of imprisonment due to the religious and political climate, and only the protection afforded by the Imperial authority kept him free to continue his work. This protection, however, did not eliminate the other obstacles he faced.\n\n5. **Peasant Revolt**: Additionally, the peasants revolted and blockaded Linz, further illustrating the chaotic and unstable environment in which Kepler was trying to complete his work. Such social unrest would have compounded the difficulties faced by Kepler, affecting not just the publication of his work but also his personal safety and well-being.\n\nDespite these considerable challenges, Kepler succeeded in publishing the Rudolphine Tables in 1627 at Ulm in four parts. The publication of these tables, which were the first to discard the conventional circular motion, was a significant achievement in the face of the difficulties outlined. However, the impact of the religious and political disturbances on his work was profound, causing delays, financial strain, and the constant threat of censorship or worse due to the prevailing attitudes towards scientific inquiry at the time.",

He acknowledges the historical roots of astronomy in astrology, suggesting a lineage or evolution from one to the other, while also indicating a certain disdain for astrology (\"this foolish daughter\") despite its financial utility. Kepler's inclusion of astrology, therefore, seems to be a pragmatic decision, driven by financial necessity rather than a belief in astrology's scientific validity. This reveals Kepler's complex views on the relationship between the two fields: he recognizes their historical and financial interdependence but maintains a clear distinction in their credibility and value as scientific disciplines.",

This gift can be seen as a mark of favor and recognition of Kepler's contributions to astronomy. Additionally, the Emperor Ferdinand allowed Kepler to attach himself to the Duke of Wallenstein, a firm believer in astrology, which further signifies the importance of Kepler's work and the recognition it received from high-ranking individuals.\n\nKepler's relationship with the Duke of Wallenstein was markedly different from his relationship with the Emperors he served. The text highlights that the Duke was a better paymaster than the three successive Emperors, furnishing Kepler with an assistant and a printing press, and obtaining for him the Professorship of Astronomy at the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg. This support contrasts with the financial struggles Kepler faced with the Emperors, as evidenced by his attempts to secure payment from the Imperial treasury for his Rudolphine Tables. Despite his efforts, including a last attempt at Ratisbon that left him disappointed and fatigued, Kepler did not receive the 8000 crowns still owed to him by the Imperial treasury for the Tables. This difference in support and financial remuneration highlights the more beneficial and supportive nature of Kepler's relationship with the Duke of Wallenstein compared to his experiences with the Emperors.",

In 1624, he managed to extract 6000 florins from the Treasury for expenses related to the Tables but faced further delays and challenges, including his library being sealed up by the Jesuits and the blockade of Linz by revolting peasants. Despite these obstacles, the Rudolphine Tables were published in 1627. Kepler's financial struggles continued, and in 1624, instead of receiving a further grant, he was given letters to the States of Swabia to collect owed money. His journey to Ratisbon in an attempt to secure payment from the Imperial treasury ended in disappointment and fatigue, leading to his rapid succumbing to a fever and dying in November 1630, at the age of fifty-nine.\n\nPosthumously, Kepler's family faced financial hardship. His daughter, Susanna, managed to obtain part of Kepler's arrears of salary by threatening to keep Tycho's manuscripts, but her stepmother was left almost penniless with five young children. To benefit the family, Louis Kepler, his son, printed a \"Dream of Lunar Astronomy,\" a work that combined saga, fairy tale, and some astronomy, which Kepler and his brother-in-law had been preparing for publication at the time of their respective deaths. Kepler left behind numerous unpublished writings, and no attempt at a complete edition of his works was made for a long time. Eventually, the manuscripts were purchased for the Imperial Russian library, and an edition was brought out at Frankfort by C. Frisch, in eight volumes, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870.\n\nThis period of Kepler's life and the subsequent fate of his family and works highlight the financial and personal struggles he faced, as well as the delayed recognition and publication of his contributions to astronomy and science.",

He describes Kepler as \"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish himself by his discoveries,\" indicating a high level of ambition and energy in pursuit of scientific breakthroughs. Delambre acknowledges that not all of Kepler's attempts were successful, labeling the unsuccessful ones as \"fanciful\" while praising the successful ones as \"sublime.\" He recognizes Kepler's perseverance and the qualities that enabled him to make significant discoveries, even though he also pursued what Delambre considers chimeras, or impossible dreams. This perspective suggests an appreciation for Kepler's dedication and effort, while also acknowledging the limitations and missteps in his work.\n\nBerry's view, on the other hand, emphasizes the inefficiency and speculative nature of much of Kepler's work, suggesting that valuable results were often buried in \"a great mass of tedious speculation\" and might have been arrived at by \"mere accident.\" Berry expresses regret over the potential waste of Kepler's intelligence on speculative endeavors and questions the intellectual discipline behind Kepler's work. However, Berry also notes Kepler's commitment to comparing speculative results with observed facts and his readiness to abandon theories that could not withstand empirical scrutiny. This highlights a respect for Kepler's intellectual honesty and his methodological rigor, despite criticisms of his speculative tendencies.\n\nProfessor Forbes offers a more enthusiastic and unequivocal endorsement of Kepler's contributions, positioning him as irreplaceable in the history of astronomy. Forbes suggests that Kepler had an early understanding of universal gravitation, a concept that was crucial for the development of modern astronomy. He implies that Kepler's work laid the groundwork for future discoveries, including those by Newton, and that without Kepler, the discovery of his laws would have been unlikely, if not impossible, by anyone else. This assessment underscores the view that Kepler's contributions were foundational and transformative for the field of astronomy.\n\nThe contrast among these assessments highlights the complexity of Kepler's legacy in astronomy. Delambre and Berry acknowledge the challenges and limitations in Kepler's work, emphasizing the mix of success and failure, as well as the speculative nature of his endeavors. However, they also recognize his perseverance, enthusiasm, and methodological integrity. Professor Forbes's view elevates Kepler's contributions, suggesting that his work was indispensable for the advancement of astronomical knowledge. Together, these perspectives illustrate a multifaceted perception of Kepler's contributions to astronomy, acknowledging both his imperfections and his monumental achievements in shaping the field.",

His cantankerous mother, Catherine Kepler, had for some years been carrying on an action for slander against a woman who had accused her of administering a poisonous potion. Dame Kepler employed a young advocate who for reasons of his own \"nursed\" the case so long that after five years had elapsed without any conclusion being reached another judge was appointed, who had himself suffered from the caustic tongue of the prosecutrix, and so was already prejudiced against her. The defendant, knowing this, turned the tables on her opponent by bringing an accusation of witchcraft against her, and Catherine Kepler was imprisoned and condemned to the torture in July, 1620. Kepler, hearing of the sentence, hurried back from Linz, and succeeded in stopping the completion of the sentence, securing his mother's release the following year, as it was made clear that the only support for the case against her was her own intemperate language. Kepler returned to Linz, and his mother at once brought another action for costs and damages against her late opponent, but died before the case could be tried.\nA few months before this Sir Henry Wotton, English Ambassador to Venice, visited Kepler, and finding him as usual, almost penniless, urged him to go to England, promising him a warm welcome there. Kepler, however, would not at that time leave Germany, giving several reasons, one of which was that he dreaded the confinement of an island. Later on he expressed his willingness to go as soon as his Rudolphine Tables were published, and lecture on them, even in England, if he could not do it in Germany, and if a good enough salary were forthcoming.",

His mother, Catherine Kepler, being involved in a legal case and facing imprisonment due to accusations of witchcraft, directly affected Kepler. He rushed back to Linz upon hearing of his mother's sentence, managed to stop the completion of the sentence, and secured her release the following year. This incident shows how Kepler's family situation influenced his actions and decisions. Additionally, financial struggles also played a role in Kepler's choices. Despite being urged by the English Ambassador to go to England where he would receive a warm welcome, Kepler decided to stay in Germany due to various reasons, including financial concerns. It is mentioned that Kepler was \"almost penniless\" and expressed his willingness to go to England only after his Rudolphine Tables were published and if a good salary was offered. These instances demonstrate how Kepler's personal and family circumstances, such as his mother's legal troubles and financial instability, impacted his professional and personal life decisions.",

The paragraph mentions that Catherine Kepler was imprisoned and condemned to torture in July 1620, showcasing how accusations of witchcraft could lead to severe consequences during that period. Additionally, the paragraph highlights the influence of personal biases in legal proceedings, as the appointed judge was already prejudiced against Catherine Kepler due to a past interaction. This indicates a lack of impartiality and fairness in the legal system of that time. Overall, Catherine Kepler's legal battles exemplify the superstitious beliefs, biases, and lack of due process that characterized the societal norms and legal practices of the time.",

Some of this he succeeded in collecting, but the Tables were still further delayed by the religious disturbances then becoming violent. The Jesuits contrived to have Kepler's library sealed up, and, but for the Imperial protection, would have imprisoned him also; moreover the peasants revolted and blockaded Linz. In 1627, however, the long promised Tables, the first to discard the conventional circular motion, were at last published at Ulm in four parts. Two of these parts consisted of subsidiary Tables, of logarithms and other computing devices, another contained Tables of the elements of the sun, moon, and planets, and the fourth gave the places of a thousand stars as determined by Tycho, with Tycho's refraction Tables, which had the peculiarity of using different values for the refraction of the sun, moon, and stars. From a map prefixed to some copies of the Tables, we may infer that Kepler was one of the first, if not actually the first, to suggest the method of determining differences of longitude by occultations of stars at the moon's limb. In an Appendix, he showed how his Tables could be used by astrologers for their predictions, saying \"Astronomy is the daughter of Astrology, and this modern Astrology again is the daughter of Astronomy, bearing something of the lineaments of her grandmother; and, as I have already said, this foolish daughter, Astrology, supports her wise but needy mother, Astronomy, from the profits of a profession not generally considered creditable\". There is no doubt that Kepler strongly resented having to depend so much for his income on such methods which he certainly did not consider creditable.",

The Duke was a better paymaster than either of the three successive Emperors. He furnished Kepler with an assistant and a printing press; and obtained for him the Professorship of Astronomy at the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg. Apparently, however, the Emperor could not induce Wallenstein to take over the responsibility of the 8000 crowns, still owing from the Imperial treasury on account of the Rudolphine Tables. Kepler made a last attempt to secure payment at Ratisbon, but his journey thither brought disappointment and fatigue and left him in such a condition that he rapidly succumbed to an attack of fever, dying in November, 1630, in his fifty-ninth year. His body was buried at Ratisbon, but the tombstone was destroyed during the war then raging. His daughter, Susanna, the wife of Jacob Bartsch, a physician who had helped Kepler with his Ephemeris, lost her husband soon after her father's death, and succeeded in obtaining part of Kepler's arrears of salary by threatening to keep Tycho's manuscripts, but her stepmother was left almost penniless with five young children. For their benefit Louis Kepler printed a \"Dream of Lunar Astronomy,\" which first his father and then his brother-in-law had been preparing for publication at the time of their respective deaths. It is a curious mixture of saga and fairy tale with a little science in the way of astronomy studied from the moon, and cast in the form of a dream to overcome the practical difficulties of the hypothesis of visiting the moon. Other writings in large numbers were left unpublished. No attempt at a complete edition of Kepler's works was made for a long time. One was projected in 1714 by his biographer, Hantsch, but all that appeared was one volume of letters. After various learned bodies had declined to move in the matter the manuscripts were purchased for the Imperial Russian library. An edition was at length brought out at Frankfort by C. Frisch, in eight volumes, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870.",

The paragraph states, \"The Duke was a better paymaster than either of the three successive Emperors. He furnished Kepler with an assistant and a printing press; and obtained for him the Professorship of Astronomy at the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg.\" This demonstrates that Wallenstein's support for Kepler was more practical and effective compared to the support Kepler received from the Emperors.",

Frisch in Frankfort, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870. This indicates that obtaining the necessary resources and interest to publish Kepler's unpublished writings was a significant challenge.",

With his peculiar method of approaching problems there was bound to be an inordinate amount of chaff mixed with the grain, and he used no winnowing machine. His simplicity and transparent honesty induced him to include everything, in fact he seemed to glory in the number of false trails he laboriously followed. He was one who might be expected to find the proverbial \"needle in a haystack,\" but unfortunately the needle was not always there. Delambre says, \"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish himself by his discoveries he attempted everything, and having once obtained a glimpse of one, no labour was too hard for him in following or verifying it. All his attempts had not the same success, and in fact that was impossible. Those which have failed seem to us only fanciful; those which have been more fortunate appear sublime. When in search of that which really existed, he has sometimes found it; when he devoted himself to the pursuit of a chimera, he could not but fail, but even then he unfolded the same qualities, and that obstinate perseverance that must triumph over all difficulties but those which are insurmountable.\" Berry, in his \"Short History of Astronomy,\" says \"as one reads chapter after chapter without a lucid, still less a correct idea, it is impossible to refrain from regrets that the intelligence of Kepler should have been so wasted, and it is difficult not to suspect at times that some of the valuable results which lie embedded in this great mass of tedious speculation were arrived at by a mere accident. On the other hand it must not be forgotten that such accidents have a habit of happening only to great men, and that if Kepler loved to give reins to his imagination he was equally impressed with the necessity of scrupulously comparing speculative results with observed facts, and of surrendering without demur the most beloved of his fancies if it was unable to stand this test. If Kepler had burnt three-quarters of what he printed, we should in all probability have formed a higher opinion of his intellectual grasp and sobriety of judgment, but we should have lost to a great extent the impression of extraordinary enthusiasm and industry, and of almost unequalled intellectual honesty which we now get from a study of his works.\"",

While Kepler was known for his enthusiasm, industry, and honesty, maintaining sobriety of judgment could have elevated his intellectual grasp and the quality of his work. Berry, in his \"Short History of Astronomy,\" suggests that if Kepler had exercised more sobriety of judgment by being more selective in what he published, his intellectual reputation might have been even higher. Berry implies that while Kepler's dedication and perseverance were admirable, a more discerning approach could have led to a clearer presentation of his valuable scientific insights. Thus, sobriety of judgment could have helped Kepler avoid diluting his significant discoveries with excessive speculation and false trails, ultimately enhancing the perception of his intellectual achievements.",
