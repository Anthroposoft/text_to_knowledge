    "text": "The Spiritual Guidance of Man and of Mankind\n\nRudolf Steiner\n\nMunich, August 20, 1911\n\n\n\n= PREFACE\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following pages are reproduced the contents of some lectures\n\ndelivered by me at Copenhagen in June last, in connection with the\n\nGeneral Meeting of the Scandinavian Theosophical Society. What is here\n\nset forth was therefore spoken to an audience acquainted with occult\n\nscience, or theosophy. A similar acquaintance is assumed in this work.\n\nIt is throughout based on the foundations given in my books, “Theosophy”\n\nand “An Outline of Occult Science.” To anyone taking up the present\n\nwork who is unacquainted with these premises, it must needs appear the\n\nstrange outpouring of mere fancy, but the above-named books point out the\n\nscientific basis of everything stated in this one.\n\n\n\nI have completely re-written the shorthand report of the lectures;\n\nnevertheless it has been my intention on publishing them, to preserve the\n\ncharacter given in oral delivery. This is specially mentioned because\n\nit is in general my opinion that the form of work intended for reading\n\nshould be quite different from that used in speaking. I have expressed\n\nthis principle of mine in all my earlier writings, as far as they were\n\nintended for the press. If in this instance I have worked out my\n\nsubject in closer connection with the spoken word, it is because I have\n\nreasons for letting the work appear at this juncture, and an adaptation\n\ncompletely in accordance with the above rule would take a great deal of\n\ntime.\n\n\n\n                                                          RUDOLF STEINER.\n\n\n\nMunich, August 20, 1911.\n\n\n\n\n\n= LECTURE I\n\n\n\n\n\nA man reflecting on his own nature soon becomes conscious that there is\n\nwithin him a second and more powerful self than the one bounded by his\n\nthoughts, his feelings and the fully-conscious impulses of his will. He\n\nbecomes aware that he is subject to that second self, as to a higher\n\npower. It is true that at first he will feel it to be a lower entity as\n\ncompared with the one limited by his intelligent and fully-conscious\n\nsoul, with its inclinations towards the Good and True. And at first he\n\nwill strive to overcome that lower entity.\n\n\n\nBut closer self-examination may reveal something else about the second\n\nself. If we often, in the course of our lives, make a kind of survey of\n\nour acts and experiences, we make a singular discovery about ourselves.\n\nAnd the older we are, the more significant do we think that discovery.\n\nIf we ask ourselves what we did or said at a particular period of our\n\nlives, it turns out that we have done very many things which are only\n\nreally understood in later years. Seven or eight, or perhaps twenty years\n\nago, we did certain things, and we know quite well that only now, long\n\nafterwards, is our intelligence ripe enough to understand what we did or\n\nsaid at that earlier period.\n\n\n\nMany people do not make such discoveries about themselves, because they\n\ndo not lay themselves out to do so. But it is extremely profitable to\n\nhold such communion frequently with one’s own soul. For directly a man\n\nbecomes aware that he has done things in former years which he is only\n\nnow beginning to understand, that formerly his intelligence was not ripe\n\nenough to understand them, at a moment such as this, something like the\n\nfollowing feeling arises in the soul: The man feels himself protected by\n\na good power, which rules in the depths of his own being; he begins to\n\nhave more and more confidence in the fact that really, in the highest\n\nsense of the word, he is not alone in the world, and that everything\n\nwhich he understands, and is consciously able to do, is after all but a\n\nsmall part of what he really accomplished in the world.\n\n\n\nIf this observation is often made, it is possible to carry out in\n\npractical life something which is very easy to see theoretically. It is\n\neasy to see that we should not make much progress in life if we had to\n\naccomplish everything we have to do, in full consciousness, with our\n\nintelligence taking note of every circumstance affecting us. In order\n\nto see this theoretically, we have only to reflect as follows: In what\n\nsection of his life does a human being perform those acts which are\n\nreally most important as regards his own existence? When does he act most\n\nwisely for himself? He does this from about the time of his birth up to\n\nthat period to which his memory goes back when in later life he surveys\n\nhis earthly existence. If he recalls what he did three, four or five\n\nyears ago, and then goes farther and farther back, he comes at last to\n\na certain point in childhood, beyond which memory cannot go. What lies\n\nbeyond it may be told by parents or others, but a man’s own recollection\n\nonly extends to a certain point in the past. That point is the moment\n\nat which the individual felt himself to be an ego. In the lives of\n\npeople whose memory is limited to the normal, there must always be such\n\na point, but previously to it, the human soul has worked in the wisest\n\npossible manner on the individual, and never afterwards, when man has\n\ngained consciousness, can he accomplish such vast and magnificent work on\n\nhimself as he carries out, from subconscious motives, during the first\n\nyears of childhood.\n\n\n\nFor we know that at birth man takes into the physical world what he\n\nhas brought with him as the result of his former earthly lives. When\n\nhe is born, his physical brain, for instance, is but a very imperfect\n\ninstrument. The soul has to work a finer organization into that\n\ninstrument, in order to make it the agent of everything which the soul\n\nis capable of performing. In point of fact the human soul, before it is\n\nfully conscious, works upon the brain so as to make it an instrument for\n\nexercising all the abilities, aptitudes, qualities, etc., which appertain\n\nto the soul as the result of its former earthly lives. This work on a\n\nman’s own body is directed from points of view which are wiser than\n\nanything which he can subsequently do for himself when in possession of\n\nfull consciousness.\n\n\n\nMoreover, man during this period not only elaborates his brain\n\nplastically, but has to learn three most important things for his earthly\n\nexistence. The first is the equilibrium of his own body in space. The\n\nman of the present day entirely overlooks the meaning of this statement,\n\nwhich touches upon one of the most essential differences between man and\n\nanimals. An animal is destined from the outset to develop its equilibrium\n\nin space in a certain way; one animal is destined to be a climber,\n\nanother a swimmer, etc. An animal is so organized from the beginning as\n\nto be able to bear itself rightly in space, and this is the case with\n\nall animals up to and including the mammals most resembling man. If\n\nzoologists would ponder this fact, they would lay less emphasis on the\n\nnumber of similar bones and muscles in man and animals, etc., for this is\n\nof much less account than the fact that man is not endowed at the outset\n\nwith the complete equipment for his conditions of equilibrium. He has\n\nfirst to form them out of the sum total of his being. It is significant\n\nthat man should have to work upon himself, in order to make, out of a\n\nbeing that cannot walk at all, one that can walk erect. It is man himself\n\nwho gives himself his vertical position, or his equilibrium in space.\n\nHe brings himself into relation with the force of gravitation. It will\n\nobviously be easy for anyone taking a superficial view of the matter to\n\nquestion this statement, with apparently good reason. It may be said\n\nthat man is just as much organized for his erect walk as, for instance,\n\na climbing animal for climbing. But more accurate observation will show\n\nthat it is the peculiarity of the animal’s organization that causes\n\nits position in space. In man it is the soul which brings itself into\n\nrelation with space and controls the organization.\n\n\n\nThe second thing which man teaches himself, and that by means of the\n\nentity which proceeds from one incarnation to another as the same being,\n\nis speech. Through speech he comes into relation with his fellow-men.\n\nThis relation makes him the vehicle of that spiritual life which\n\ninterpenetrates the world primarily through man. Emphasis has often been\n\nlaid, with good reason, on the fact that a human being removed, before he\n\ncould speak, to a desert island, and kept apart from his fellows, would\n\nnot learn to talk. On the other hand, what we receive by inheritance,\n\nwhat is implanted in us for use in later years and is subject to the\n\nprinciples of heredity, does not depend on a man’s dwelling with his\n\nfellows. For instance, his inherited conditions oblige him to change\n\nhis teeth in his seventh year. If it were possible for him to grow up\n\non a desert island, he would still change them then. But he only learns\n\nto talk, when his soul’s inner being, i.e., that which is carried on\n\nfrom one life to another, is stimulated. The germ, however, for the\n\ndevelopment of the larynx must be formed during the period at which man\n\nhas not yet acquired his ego-consciousness. Before the time to which his\n\nmemory goes back, he must plant the germ for developing his larynx, in\n\norder that this may become the organ of speech.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is a third thing: It is not so well known that man learns\n\nthis of himself, from that part of his inner being which he carries on\n\nfrom one incarnation to another. It is the life within the world of\n\nthought itself. The elaboration of the brain is undertaken because the\n\nbrain is the instrument of thought. At the beginning of life, this organ\n\nis still plastic, because the individual has to form it for himself as\n\nan instrument of thought, in accordance with the intention of the entity\n\nwhich is carried on from one life to another. The brain immediately\n\nafter birth is, as it was bound to be, in accordance with the forces\n\ninherited from parents and other ancestors. But the individual has to\n\nexpress in his thought what he is as an individual being, in accordance\n\nwith his former earthly lives. Therefore he must re-model the inherited\n\npeculiarities of his brain, after birth, when he has become physically\n\nindependent of his parents and other ancestors.\n\n\n\nWe thus see that man accomplishes momentous things during the first\n\nyears of his life. He is working on himself in the spirit of the highest\n\nwisdom. In point of fact, if it were a question of his own cleverness,\n\nit is possible that he might not accomplish what he does without\n\nthat cleverness during the first period of his life. Why is all this\n\naccomplished in those depths of the soul which lie outside consciousness?\n\nThis happens because the human soul and entire being are, during the\n\nfirst years of earthly life, in much closer connection with the\n\nspiritual worlds of the higher hierarchies than is afterwards the case.\n\nA clairvoyant who has gone through sufficient spiritual development to\n\nbe able to witness actual spiritual events, sees something exceedingly\n\nsignificant at the moment when the ego acquires consciousness, i.e.,\n\nthe earliest point to which the memory of later years goes back. Whereas\n\nwhat we call the child’s aura floats round it in its earliest years\n\nlike a wonderful human and superhuman power, and, being really the\n\nhigher part of the child, is everywhere continued on into the spiritual\n\nworld, at the moment to which memory goes back, this aura sinks more\n\ninto the inner being of the child. A human being is able to feel himself\n\na continuous ego as far back as that point of time, because then that\n\nwhich was previously in close connection with the higher worlds, passed\n\ninto his ego. Henceforward the consciousness is at every point brought\n\ninto connection with the external world. This is not the case with a very\n\nyoung child, to whom things appear only as a surrounding world of dreams.\n\n\n\nMan works on himself by means of a wisdom which is not within him. That\n\nwisdom is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom of\n\nlater years. The higher wisdom becomes obscured in the human soul, which\n\nin exchange receives consciousness.\n\n\n\nThe higher wisdom works from out of the spiritual world deep into the\n\nbodily part of man, so that man is able by its means to form his brain\n\nout of spirit. It is rightly said that even the wisest may learn from\n\na child, for in the child is working the wisdom which does not pass\n\nlater into consciousness. Through that wisdom man has something like\n\ntelephonic connection with the spiritual beings in whose world he lives\n\nbetween death and re-birth. From that world there is something still\n\nstreaming into the aura of a child, which is, as an individual being,\n\nimmediately under the guidance of the entire spiritual world to which\n\nit belongs. Spiritual forces from that world continue to flow into a\n\nchild. They cease so to flow at the point of time to which memory goes\n\nback. It is these forces which enable a child to bring itself into a\n\ndefinite relation to gravitation. They form the larynx, and so mould the\n\nbrain that it becomes a living instrument for the expression of thought,\n\nfeeling and will.\n\n\n\nWhat is present in childhood to a supreme degree, so that the individual\n\nis then working out of a self which is still in direct connection with\n\nhigher worlds, continues to some extent even in later years, although\n\nthe conditions change in the manner indicated above. If at a later stage\n\nof life we feel that we did something years before which we are only\n\nnow able to understand, it is just because we previously let ourselves\n\nbe guided by higher wisdom, and only after the lapse of years have we\n\nattained to an understanding of the reasons of our conduct.\n\n\n\nFrom all this we can feel that, immediately after birth, we had not\n\nescaped so very far from the world in which we were before entering\n\nupon physical existence, and that we can never really escape from it\n\nwholly. Our share in higher spirituality enters our physical life and\n\naccompanies us throughout it. We often feel that what is within us is not\n\nonly a higher self which is gradually being evolved, but is something\n\nhigher which is there already, and is the motive cause of our so often\n\ndeveloping beyond ourselves.\n\n\n\nAll ideals and artistic creations which man is able to produce, as well\n\nas all the natural healing forces in his own body, by means of which he\n\nis continually able to adjust the injuries that befall him in life, all\n\nthese powers do not proceed from ordinary intellect, but from those\n\ndeeper forces which in our earliest years are at work on our equilibrium\n\nin space, on the formation of our larynx and on the brain. For these\n\nsame forces are still at work in man in later years. When sickness\n\nattacks us, it is often said that external forces cannot help us, but\n\nthat our organism must develop the healing powers latent within it:\n\nby this is meant that there is a profoundly wise activity present in\n\nhumanity. Moreover, it is from the same source that proceed these best\n\nforces whereby knowledge of the spiritual world is attained, i.e., true\n\nclairvoyance.\n\n\n\nThe question now suggests itself, why do the higher forces which have\n\nbeen described work upon human nature only during early childhood?\n\nOne-half of the answer may be easily given as follows: If those higher\n\nforces went on working in the same way, man would be always a child.\n\nHe would not attain the full ego-consciousness. From within his own\n\nbeing must proceed the motive power which previously worked on him from\n\nwithout. But there is a more important reason, which explains still more\n\nabout the mysteries of human life than what has just been said, and that\n\nis the following:\n\n\n\nIt is possible to learn through occult science, that the human body, as\n\nit exists at its present stage of evolution, must be regarded as having\n\narrived at its present form under different circumstances. It is known to\n\nthe occultist that this evolution was effected by means of the working\n\nof various forces on the sum-total of man’s being; certain forces worked\n\non the physical body, others on the etheric, others on the astral body.\n\nHuman nature has arrived at its present form through the action of those\n\nbeings whom we call the Luciferic and Ahrimanic. By their means it has,\n\nin a certain way, become worse than it need have been if those forces\n\nonly had been active within it which proceed from the spiritual rulers\n\nof the cosmos who desire to evolve man along straight lines. The causes\n\nof sorrow, disease and even of death are to be sought in the fact that,\n\nbesides the beings who are evolving man in a straight line forwards,\n\nthere are also ruling the Luciferic and Ahrimanic spirits, who are\n\ncontinually crossing the line of straightforward, progressive development.\n\n\n\nThere is something in what man brings into existence at birth, which is\n\nbetter than what he can make out of it in later life. This is so, because\n\nthe Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces have but little influence over man\n\nduring early childhood; they are virtually only operative in what man\n\nmakes out of himself by his conscious life. If he were to retain in full\n\nforce beyond early childhood that part of his being which is better than\n\nthe rest, he would be unable to endure its influence, because his whole\n\nbeing is weakened by the opposite forces of Lucifer and Ahriman. Man’s\n\norganism in the physical world is so constituted that it is only when\n\nhe is, so to speak, as soft and pliable as a child, that he can endure\n\nwithin him those direct forces of the spiritual world which operate\n\nwithin him during early childhood. He would be shattered, if during\n\nhis later life there were still directly working in him those forces\n\nwhich underlie the faculty of equilibrium in space, and the formation\n\nof the larynx and the brain. Those forces are so tremendous that, if\n\nthey were to go on working, our organism would pine away under the\n\ninfluence of their holiness. Man must only have recourse to such forces\n\nfor the purpose of that kind of activity which brings him into conscious\n\nconnection with the supersensible world.\n\n\n\nBut out of this there arises a thought which is of great significance,\n\nif rightly understood. It is expressed in the New Testament in the words\n\n“Except ye become as little children, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom\n\nof Heaven.” What then becomes manifest as man’s highest ideal, if what\n\nhas just been said be rightly received? Surely this, the drawing ever\n\nnearer and nearer to what we may call a conscious relation to the forces\n\nwhich work in man unknown to him during early childhood. Only it must be\n\nborne in mind that man would collapse under the power of those forces,\n\nif they were at once to operate in his conscious life. For this reason,\n\ncareful preparation is necessary for the attainment of those faculties\n\nwhich induce the perception of supersensible worlds. The object of such\n\npreparation is to qualify man to bear what he is unable to bear in\n\nordinary life.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the passing of the individual through successive incarnations is of\n\nimportance for the collective evolution of the human race. The latter has\n\nadvanced through successive lives in the past, and is still advancing,\n\nand parallel with it the earth too is moving forwards in its evolution.\n\nThe time will come when the earth will have reached the end of its\n\ncareer. Then the earthly planet will fall away as a physical entity from\n\nthe sum-total of human souls, just as the human body falls away from the\n\nspirit at death, when, in order to continue living, the soul enters the\n\nspiritual realm which is adapted for it between death and re-birth. When\n\nonce this is realized, it must appear as man’s highest ideal to have\n\nprogressed far enough at earthly death, to be able to reap all possible\n\nbenefits which may be obtained from earthly life.\n\n\n\nNow those forces which prevent man from being able to endure the forces\n\nworking upon him during early childhood come out of the substance of\n\nthe earth. When this has fallen away from a human being, the latter,\n\nif he has attained the aim of his life, must have advanced far enough\n\nto be able actually to give himself up, with his whole being, to the\n\npowers which at present are only active in man during childhood. Thus\n\nthe object of evolution through successive earthly lives is gradually to\n\nmake the whole individual, including therefore the conscious part, into\n\nan expression of the powers which are ruling in him under the influence\n\nof the spiritual world, though he does not know it, during the first\n\nyears of his life. The thought which takes possession of the soul after\n\nsuch reflections as these, must fill it with humility, but also with a\n\ndue consciousness of the dignity of man. The thought is this: man is\n\nnot alone; there is something living within him which is constantly\n\naffording him proof that he can rise above himself to something which is\n\nalready growing beyond him, and which will go on growing from one life to\n\nanother. This thought can assume more and more definite form; and in that\n\ncase it affords something supremely soothing and elevating, at the same\n\ntime filling the soul with corresponding humility and modesty. What is it\n\nthat man has within him in this way? Surely a higher, divine human being,\n\nby whom he is able to feel himself interpenetrated, saying to himself,\n\n“He is my guide within me.”\n\n\n\nFrom such a point of view, it is not long before we arrive at the thought\n\nthat by all the means in our power we should strive to be in harmony with\n\nthat within our being which is wiser than conscious intelligence. And\n\nwe shall be referred on from the directly conscious self to an enlarged\n\nself, in the presence of which all false pride and presumption will be\n\nextinguished and subdued. This feeling develops into another, which\n\nopens the way to accurate understanding of the nature of present human\n\nimperfection; and the consciousness of this leads to the knowledge that\n\nman may become perfect, if once the larger spirituality ruling within him\n\nis allowed to bear the same relation to his consciousness which it bore\n\nto the unconscious life of the soul in early childhood.\n\n\n\nIf it often happens that memory does not go back as far as the fourth\n\nyear of a child’s life, it may nevertheless be said that the influence\n\nof the higher spirit-sphere, in the above sense, lasts through the first\n\nthree years. At the end of that span of time a child becomes capable of\n\nlinking its impressions of the outer world to the ideas of its ego. It is\n\ntrue that this coherent ego-conception can only be reckoned as existing\n\nas far back as memory extends. Yet we must say that virtually memory\n\nextends to the beginning of the fourth year, only it is so weak at the\n\nbeginning of distinct ego-consciousness as to be imperceptible. It may\n\ntherefore be granted that those higher powers which dispose of a human\n\nbeing in the early years of childhood can be operative for three years;\n\ntherefore man, during the present middle period of the earth, is so\n\norganized that he can receive these forces for only three years.\n\n\n\nSupposing a man now stood before us, and that some cosmic powers could\n\ncause his ordinary ego to be removed. (For this purpose we must assume\n\nthat it would be possible to remove from the physical, etheric and astral\n\nbodies the ordinary ego which has gone through the incarnations with the\n\nman.) And now suppose that an ego could then be introduced into the three\n\nbodies which is working in connection with spiritual worlds, what would\n\nhappen to a person thus treated? At the end of three years his body would\n\nnecessarily be shattered. Something would occur, through cosmic karma,\n\nwhich would prevent the spirit-being which would be in connection with\n\nhigher worlds, from living more than three years in that body.[1] Only\n\nat the end of all his earthly lives will man have that within him which\n\nwill enable him to live more than three years with that spirit-being. But\n\nthen, it is true, man will be able to say to himself, “Not I, but that\n\nHigher One within me, Who was always there, is now working in me.” Till\n\nthat time comes, he is not able to say this. The most he can say is that\n\nhe feels that higher being, but has not yet progressed far enough with\n\nhis real, actual human ego, to be able to bring the other to full life\n\nwithin him.\n\n\n\nSupposing then that, at some time in the middle earth-period, a human\n\norganism were to come into the world, and later in life be freed from his\n\nego by the action of certain cosmic powers, receiving in exchange the ego\n\nwhich usually only works in man during the first three years of life,\n\nand which would be in connection with the spiritual worlds in which man\n\nexists between death and re-birth: how long would such a person be able\n\nto live in an earthly body? About three years. For at the end of that\n\ntime, something would arise through cosmic karma, which would destroy the\n\nhuman organism in question.\n\n\n\nWhat is here supposed is, however, a historical fact. The human organism\n\nwhich stood in the river Jordan at John’s baptism when the ego of Jesus\n\nof Nazareth left the three bodies, contained, after the baptism, in\n\ncomplete conscious development, that higher Self of humanity which\n\nusually works with cosmic wisdom on a child without its knowledge. At the\n\nsame time, the necessity arose that this Self which was in connection\n\nwith the higher spirit-world could only live for three years in the\n\nappropriate human organism. Events had then to take place which brought\n\nthe earthly life of that being to a close. The outer events in the life\n\nof Christ Jesus are to be interpreted as absolutely conditioned by the\n\ninner causes just set forth, and present themselves as the outward\n\nexpression of those causes.\n\n\n\nWe are now able to see the deeper connection existing between that which\n\nis man’s guide in life, which streams in upon our childhood like the dawn\n\nand is always working below the surface of our consciousness as the best\n\npart of us, and that which once upon a time entered the whole of human\n\nevolution and was able to dwell for three years in a human frame.\n\n\n\nWhat then is manifested in that “higher” ego, which is in connection with\n\nthe spiritual hierarchies, and which in due time entered the body of\n\nJesus of Nazareth? This entrance being symbolically represented by the\n\nsign of the Spirit descending in the form of a dove, and by the words,\n\n“This is my well-beloved Son, to-day have I begotten him” (for so stood\n\nthe words originally). If we fix our eyes upon this picture, we are\n\ncontemplating the highest human ideal. For it means nothing else than\n\nthat the history of Jesus of Nazareth is a statement of this fact: “The\n\nChrist can be discerned in every human being.” And even if there were no\n\nGospels and no tradition, to tell us that once a Christ lived on earth,\n\nwe should yet learn through knowledge of human nature that the Christ is\n\nliving in man.\n\n\n\nThe recognition of the forces working in human nature during childhood is\n\nthe recognition of the Christ in man. The question now arises, does this\n\nrecognition lead to the further perception of the fact that this Christ\n\nonce really dwelt on earth in a human body? Without bringing forward\n\nany documents, this question may be answered in the affirmative. For\n\ngenuine clairvoyant knowledge of self leads the man of the present day\n\nto see that powers are to be discovered in the human soul which emanate\n\nfrom the Christ. These powers are at work during the first three years\n\nof childhood without any action being taken by the human being. In later\n\nlife they may be called into action, if the Christ be sought within the\n\nsoul by inner meditation. Man was not always able, as he is now, to find\n\nthe Christ within himself. There were times when no inner meditation\n\ncould lead him to the Christ. This again we learn from clairvoyant\n\nperception. In the interval between that past time when man could not\n\nfind the Christ in himself, and the present time when he can find him,\n\nthere took place Christ’s earthly life. And that life itself is the cause\n\nof man’s being able to find the Christ in himself in the manner that has\n\nbeen pointed out. Thus to clairvoyant perception the earthly life of\n\nChrist is proved without any historical records.\n\n\n\nIt is just as if the Christ had said, “I will be such an ideal for you\n\nhuman beings as, raised to a spiritual level, will show you that which\n\nis fulfilled in each human body.” In his early childhood man learns from\n\nthe spirit how to walk physically, i.e., he is shown by the spirit his\n\nway through earthly life. From the spirit he learns to speak, i.e.,\n\nto form truth; or in other words, he develops the essence of truth\n\nout of sound during the first three years of his life. And the life\n\ntoo, which man lives on earth as an ego-being, obtains its vital organ\n\nthrough what is formed in the first three years of childhood. Thus man\n\nlearns to walk, i.e., to find “the way,” he learns to present “truth”\n\nthrough his physical organism, and he learns to bring “life” from the\n\nspirit into expression in his body. No more significant re-interpretation\n\nseems possible of the words “Except ye become as little children, ye\n\ncannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And momentous is that saying\n\nin which the ego-being of the Christ comes into expression thus, “I am\n\nthe Way, the Truth and the Life.” Just as, unknown to a child, the higher\n\nspirit-forces are fashioning its organism to become the bodily expression\n\nof the way, the truth and the life, so the spirit of man, through being\n\ninterpenetrated with the Christ, gradually becomes the conscious\n\nvehicle of the way, the truth and the life. He is thereby making himself,\n\nin the course of his earthly development, into that force which bears\n\nsway within him as a child, when he is not consciously its vehicle.\n\n\n\nThis saying about the way, the truth and the life is capable of opening\n\nthe doors of eternity. It sounds to man out of the depths of his soul, if\n\nhis self-knowledge is true and real.\n\n\n\nSuch reflections as these open up, in a double sense, the vision of the\n\nspiritual guidance of the individual and of collective humanity. As human\n\nbeings we are able, through self-knowledge, to find the Christ within us\n\nas the guide Whom, since His life on earth, we can always reach, because\n\nHe is always in man. And further, if we apply to the historical records\n\nthat we have apprehended without them, we discover their real nature.\n\nThey express historically something which is revealed of itself in the\n\ndepths of the soul. They are therefore to be accounted as guiding\n\nhumanity in the same direction as the soul itself is proceeding.\n\n\n\nIf we thus understand the suggestion of eternity in the words, “I am\n\nthe way, the truth and the life,” we cannot feel ourselves justified\n\nin asking, “Why does a person who has passed through many incarnations\n\nalways re-enter life as a child?” For it becomes evident that this\n\napparent imperfection is an ever-recurring reminder of the Highest that\n\nis in man. And we cannot be reminded often enough, at any rate each time\n\nwe enter earthly life is not too often to be reminded, of the great fact\n\nof what man really is with reference to that Being who underlies all\n\nearthly existence, without being touched by its imperfections.\n\n\n\nIt is not well to make many definitions or summaries in occult science\n\nor theosophy, or indeed in occultism generally. It is better to give\n\na description, and to try and call forth a feeling of what really\n\nexists. On this account we are now attempting to induce a feeling of\n\nwhat distinguishes the first three years of human life, and of the way\n\nin which this is related to the light that streams from the cross on\n\nGolgotha. The meaning of this feeling is that an impulse is passing\n\nthrough human evolution, and that through this impulse the Pauline\n\nsaying, “Not I but the Christ in me,” will become a fact. We have only\n\nto know what man is in reality, in order to be able to proceed from such\n\nknowledge to insight into the nature of the Christ. When once, however,\n\nwe have arrived at the Christ-idea through true observation of humanity,\n\nwe know that we discover the Christ in the best way if we first look for\n\nHim in ourselves, and if we then return to the Bible records, these are\n\nfor the first time rightly valued. And no one prizes the Bible more, or\n\nmore consciously, than one who has found the Christ in this way. It is\n\npossible to imagine a being, let us say an inhabitant of Mars, descending\n\nto earth, without ever having heard of the Christ and His work. Much\n\nthat has taken place on earth would be incomprehensible to the Martian;\n\nmuch that interests people nowadays would not interest him. But it would\n\ninterest him to discover the central impulse of earthly evolution,\n\ni.e., the Christ-idea, as it is expressed in human nature itself.\n\n\n\nOne who has grasped this, is able for the first time rightly to\n\nunderstand the Bible, for he finds expressed there in a marvellous way\n\nwhat he has previously observed in himself, and he says: It is not\n\nnecessary to have been brought up with any special reverence for the\n\nGospel; they need only be presented to me, a fully-conscious human\n\nbeing, to stand revealed in all their greatness, by means of what I have\n\nlearnt through occult science.\n\n\n\nIt is indeed not too much to say that a time will come when it will be\n\nrecognized by people who have learned through occult science rightly\n\nto appreciate the contents of the Gospels, that these are guides of\n\nthe human race in a sense which is more just to those writings than\n\npeople have hitherto been to them. It is only through knowledge of human\n\nnature itself that humanity will learn to see what is latent in those\n\nprofound records. It will then be said: If there is to be found in the\n\nGospels that which forms an integral part of human nature, it must have\n\ncome from the people who wrote these documents on earth. Therefore what\n\ngenuine reflection brings home to us about our own lives, the more\n\nso the older we grow must hold especially good with regard to those\n\nwriters. We ourselves have done many things which we only understand\n\nyears afterwards, and in the writers of the Gospels may be seen people\n\nwho wrote out of the higher self which works in man during childhood,\n\nso that the Gospels are writings emanating from the wisdom which moulds\n\nhuman nature. Man through his body is a manifestation of spirit, and the\n\nGospels are such a manifestation in writing.\n\n\n\nOn this assumption the idea of inspiration regains its true and loftier\n\nmeaning. Just as higher forces are at work on the brain during the first\n\nthree years of childhood, so there were higher forces from spiritual\n\nworlds impressed on the souls of the Evangelists, under the influence\n\nof which they wrote the Gospels. The spiritual guidance of humanity is\n\nexpressed in such a fact as this. For the human race must surely be\n\nguided, if within it there are people working who write records under\n\nthe influence of the same powers that are at work on the moulding of man\n\nin profound wisdom. And just as the individual says or does things which\n\nhe only understands at a later period of life, so collective humanity\n\nhas produced in the Evangelists means of revelation which can only be\n\nunderstood by degrees. The farther humanity progresses, the greater will\n\nbe the understanding of these records. The individual can feel spiritual\n\nguidance within himself; and collective humanity can feel it in those of\n\nits members who work as did the writers of the Gospels.\n\n\n\nThe idea thus gained of the guidance of humanity may be extended in many\n\ndirections. Let us suppose that a man finds disciples, a few people\n\nwho follow him. Such an one will soon become aware, through genuine\n\nself-knowledge, that the very fact of his finding disciples gives him\n\nthe feeling that what he has to say does not originate with himself.\n\nThe case is rather this, that spiritual powers in higher worlds wish\n\nto communicate with the disciples, and find in the Teacher the fitting\n\ninstrument for their manifestation.\n\n\n\nThe thought will suggest itself to such a man: when I was a child I\n\nworked on myself by the aid of forces proceeding from the spiritual\n\nworld, and what I am now able to give, of my best, must also proceed\n\nfrom higher worlds; I may not look upon it as belonging to my ordinary\n\nconsciousness. Such a man may in fact say: something demonic, something\n\nlike a “daimon” using the word in the sense of a good spiritual\n\npower is working out of a spiritual world through me on my disciples.\n\n\n\nSocrates felt something of this kind. Plato tells us that he spoke of\n\nhis “daimon” as of the one who led and guided him. Many attempts have\n\nbeen made to explain this “daimon” of Socrates, but it can only be\n\nexplained by supposing that Socrates was able to feel something like\n\nthat which results from the above reflections. Then we are able to\n\nunderstand that throughout the three or four centuries during which the\n\nSocratic principle was active in Greece, a state of feeling permeated\n\nthe Greek world through Socrates, which prepared the way for another\n\ngreat event. The feeling that man, as he now is, is not the whole of\n\nwhat comes through from higher worlds, this feeling went on working.\n\nThe best of those in whom it was present were those who afterwards best\n\nunderstood the words, “Not I, but the Christ in me.” For they could say\n\nto themselves: Socrates used to speak of a being working as a “daimon”\n\nfrom higher worlds; the Christ-ideal makes clear what Socrates meant.\n\nOnly Socrates could not as yet speak of Christ, because in his time no\n\none was able to find the Christ-nature within himself.\n\n\n\nHere again we feel something of the spiritual guidance of the race, for\n\nnothing can be established in the world without preparation. Why was it\n\nthat Paul found his best disciples in Greece? Because the ground had been\n\nprepared there by the teaching of Socrates and the state of feeling that\n\nhas been described. That is to say, what happens in human evolution may\n\nbe traced back to events which operated previously, and made people ripe\n\nfor what was afterwards to be brought to bear upon them. Do we not feel\n\nhere how far the guiding impulse passing through human evolution extends\n\nand how at the right moment it places people where they will be best used\n\nto further evolution? In such facts is manifested the guidance of the\n\nhuman race in a general way.\n\n\n\n[1] The vitality of the human organism is maintained at the transition\n\nfrom childhood to later life, because the organism is capable of change\n\nat that period. Later in life, it is no longer susceptible of change, and\n\non this account cannot continue to exist with that other Self.\n\n\n\n= LECTURE II\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we turn our attention to what was said by the teachers and leaders\n\nof ancient Egypt about the direction and guidance of the spiritual\n\nlife of their country, we may trace a remarkable parallel between what\n\nis manifested in the individual life of man, and what governs human\n\nevolution as a whole. It is related that when a Greek once asked an\n\nEgyptian, who had guided and led his nation from ancient times onwards,\n\nhe answered, “In far off times of yore, the gods ruled and taught us, and\n\nonly afterwards men came to be our leaders.” The Egyptians named Menes to\n\nthe Greeks, as their first leader on the physical plane to be recognized\n\nas a human leader. That is to say, the directors of the Egyptian people\n\nalleged that in earlier times the gods themselves as Greek records\n\nsay guided and led the Egyptian nation. Such an assertion, coming down\n\nto us from ancient times, must, however, be rightly understood. What did\n\nthe Egyptians mean when they said, “Our kings and great teachers were\n\ngods”?\n\n\n\nThe man who thus answered the question of the Greek meant that if any\n\none had gone back into the ancient times of the Egyptian nation, and\n\nhad asked those people who felt something within them like a higher\n\nconsciousness, or wisdom from higher worlds, “Who are really your\n\nteachers?” they would have answered, “If I wanted to tell you about my\n\nreal teacher, I should not point to such and such a person and say, ‘That\n\nis my teacher,’ but I should first have to put myself into a clairvoyant\n\nstate, (it is known from occult science that this was comparatively\n\neasier in ancient times than it is now,) and then I should find my real\n\ninspirer and teacher, who comes to me only when the eyes of my spirit\n\nare opened.” For in ancient Egypt, beings who were not incarnated in a\n\nphysical human body came down amongst men. In those remote ages, it was\n\nthe gods who still ruled and taught the Egyptians, and by “gods” they\n\nunderstood beings who had preceded man in evolution.\n\n\n\nAccording to occult science, the earth passed through an earlier\n\nplanetary condition, called the “Moon-state,” before it became “Earth.”\n\nDuring this condition man was not yet human in the present sense of the\n\nword; but there were on the old Moon other beings, not possessed of the\n\npresent human form and differently constituted, who nevertheless were\n\nthen at the evolutionary stage which man has now attained on earth. We\n\nmay therefore say, that on the ancient Moon-planet which has perished,\n\nand out of which the earth afterwards originated, there lived beings who\n\nwere man’s predecessors. In Christian esoteric language they are called\n\nAngel-beings (Angeloi) and the beings immediately above them Archangels\n\n(Archangeloi). The latter were human at a still earlier period than the\n\nangels. What are called angels or Angeloi in Christian esotericism, and\n\nDhyanic beings in Eastern mysticism, were “men” during the Moon-period.\n\nNow these beings, during the present earth-period, are a stage farther\n\nadvanced than man, those of them, that is to say, who completed their\n\nevolution on the Moon. Only at the end of the earth’s evolution will man\n\nhave arrived at the stage which those beings had reached at the end of\n\nthe Moon-period.\n\n\n\nWhen the earth-state of our planet began, and man appeared on earth,\n\nthese beings were not able to appear in an external human form, for the\n\nhuman body of flesh and blood is essentially a product of earth, and\n\nis only adapted to the beings who are now human. The beings, who are a\n\nstage farther advanced than man, could not be incarnated in human bodies\n\nwhen the earth was beginning its evolution. They were only able to take\n\na part in the government of the earth by illuminating and inspiring\n\npeople in primeval times in the condition to which these attained when\n\nclairvoyant. Indirectly, then, through these clairvoyant people, the\n\nangels intervened to guide the destinies of earth.\n\n\n\nThus the ancient Egyptians still remembered a condition of things during\n\nwhich the leading personalities of the nation were clearly conscious of\n\ntheir connection with what are called gods, angels, or dhyanic beings.\n\nNow what sort of beings were these, who were not incarnated in a human\n\nform of flesh and blood, but influenced mankind in the way we have\n\ndescribed? They were man’s predecessors, who had progressed beyond the\n\nhuman stage.\n\n\n\nThere is in these days much misuse of a word which may in this connection\n\nbe applied in its true meaning, the word “Superman.” If we really wish\n\nto speak of “Supermen,” it is these beings who may rightly be so called,\n\nwho were human during the Moon-period, the planetary stage preceding\n\nour earth and who have now outgrown humanity. They were only able to\n\nappear in an etheric body to clairvoyants. It was thus that they came\n\ndown to earth from spiritual worlds, and ruled there even as late as\n\npost-Atlantean times.\n\n\n\nThese beings had, and still have, the remarkable quality of not being\n\nobliged to think; in fact, we might even say that they cannot think at\n\nall as man does. How then does man think? More or less in this way. He\n\nstarts from a certain point and says, “I understand this or that,” and\n\nfrom that point he then tries to understand various other things. If this\n\nwere not the method of human thought, school-life would not be such a\n\ndifficult period for many. We cannot learn mathematics in a day, because\n\nwe have to begin at a certain point, and go slowly forwards. This takes\n\na long time. We cannot survey a whole world of thought at a glance, for\n\nhuman thought runs its course in time. A system of thought does not\n\nenter the mind in a flash. We have to make an effort, and have to exert\n\nourselves, in order to find the sequence of thought. The beings described\n\nabove are without this human peculiarity. A far-reaching train of thought\n\ncomes into their minds with the same rapidity with which an animal makes\n\nup its mind that it will snatch at something which its instinct tells it\n\nis eatable. Instinct and reflective consciousness are in no wise distinct\n\nin these beings, they are one and the same thing. Just as animals have\n\ninstinct at their stage of evolution, in their kingdom, so these dhyanic\n\nbeings or angels have direct spiritual thought and conceptions. By virtue\n\nof this instinctive inner life of conception, they are of an essentially\n\ndifferent nature from human beings.\n\n\n\nNow we can easily form an idea of the impossibility of the use by these\n\nbeings of a brain or physical body such as we have. They have to use an\n\netheric body, because the human body and brain only allow of thoughts in\n\ntime, whereas these beings do not develop their thoughts in time,\n\nbut feel the wisdom that is approaching them blaze forth, as it were,\n\nspontaneously within them. It is impossible for them to think erroneously\n\nin the sense in which man does. The process of their thought is a direct\n\ninspiration. Hence the personalities who were able to come into contact\n\nwith these superhuman or angelic beings, were conscious that they were in\n\nthe presence of unerring wisdom. Therefore, even as late as in ancient\n\nEgyptian times when the man who was the human teacher or king was in\n\nthe presence of his spiritual guide, he felt thus: the command which he\n\nis giving, the truth which he is enunciating, is literally right, and\n\ncannot be wrong. (This was also felt by those to whom the truths were\n\npassed on.)\n\n\n\nThe clairvoyant guides of the human race were able to speak in such a\n\nmanner that in their words people believed they were receiving exactly\n\nwhat came down from the spiritual world. In short, there was a direct\n\ncurrent down from the higher spirit-hierarchies which were directing\n\nhumanity. Thus what works on the individual in early childhood may\n\nbe seen working on humanity at large in the form of the next world of\n\nspirit-hierarchies which hovers over human evolution as a whole. This\n\nis the next kingdom of the angels or superhuman beings, standing a\n\nstep higher than man, and extending directly into spiritual spheres.\n\nThey bring down to earth from those spheres what is worked into human\n\ncivilization. In the child, it is on the formation of the body that the\n\nhigher wisdom leaves its impress; in human evolution of past ages, it was\n\ncivilization that was so matured.\n\n\n\nThus the Egyptians, who described themselves as being in connection\n\nwith divinity, felt that the soul of humanity was open to the action of\n\nspirit hierarchies. Just as the soul of a child opens its aura to the\n\nhierarchies up to the time mentioned in the preceding pages, so, through\n\nits work, did the whole of humanity open its world to the hierarchies\n\nwith which it was connected.\n\n\n\nThis connection was most important in those teachers whom we call the\n\nholy teachers of India, the great teachers of the first post-Atlantean\n\nor Indian civilization, which unfolded itself in Southern Asia. When the\n\nAtlantean catastrophe was over, and the physiognomy of the earth had\n\nchanged, so that the new conformation of Asia, Europe and Africa had\n\nevolved in the Eastern hemisphere, the civilization led by the ancient\n\ngreat teachers of India began. This was before the time we have mentioned\n\nas reported in ancient records. The man of to-day is apt to get quite\n\na wrong idea about these teachers. If, for example, one of the great\n\nIndian teachers were to be confronted with an educated man of the present\n\nday, the latter would gaze upon him with astonishment, and perhaps say,\n\n“Is that a great teacher? I should never have thought it.” For using\n\nthe words “clever” or “learned” in the sense in which modern people of\n\nculture do, the holy teachers of ancient India had nothing clever to say.\n\nThey were, in the present sense of the words, simple, homely people,\n\nwho would have answered even questions of everyday life in the simplest\n\nfashion possible. And there were many periods during which scarcely\n\nanything could be elicited from them but what would seem, to an educated\n\nman of to-day, most insignificant. But on the other hand, there were\n\ncertain times when these holy teachers were revealed as something more\n\nthan simple, homely men. At these times they were obliged to be together\n\nto the number of seven, because what each individual was able to feel\n\nhad to combine harmoniously with the other six teachers, as though in a\n\nconsonance of seven sounds. For it was then possible for each one to see\n\nsomething according to his particular gift and degree of development,\n\nso that from the harmony of the separate parts which each individual\n\nwas able to see, there arose what comes down to us from ancient times\n\nas primeval wisdom, that is supposing we know how to decipher the real\n\noccult records. These records are not the revelations of the Vedas,\n\nhowever much we may admire them. What the Indian holy teachers taught\n\nis of much earlier date than the composition of the Vedas, and it is\n\nonly a feeble echo of their wisdom which lies before us in these mighty\n\nworks. But when each of these men was in the presence of a superhuman\n\npredecessor of humanity, was gazing clairvoyantly into higher worlds\n\nand listening clairaudiently to what was being taught through that\n\npredecessor, it was as though the sun shone out of their eyes. What\n\nthey were then able to say worked with overpowering force on their\n\nenvironment, so that all who heard them knew that it was not human life\n\nor wisdom that was speaking, but that gods, superhuman beings, were\n\ninfluencing human civilization.\n\n\n\nThe ancient civilizations had their rise in this sounding through to\n\nmankind of the knowledge of the gods. Only by degrees in post-Atlantean\n\ntimes was the door, so to speak, closed into the divine spiritual world\n\nwhich in the Atlantean period had still been wide open for the human\n\nsoul. And in the various countries and nations it was felt that man was\n\nthrown ever more and more on his own resources. What is revealed in the\n\ncase of a child appears in humanity at large in a different way. The\n\ndivine spiritual world is first diffused into the unconscious soul of a\n\nchild, and the soul works upon the formation of the body. Then comes the\n\nmoment at which the child learns to feel itself an “ego” and this is the\n\nmoment to which its memory goes back in later life. This is what makes\n\nit possible to say that the wisest of men may still learn something from\n\nthe soul of a child. From this point, however, the individual is left to\n\nhimself. The ego-consciousness comes into being, and everything combines\n\nto make it possible for him to remember his experiences.\n\n\n\nSo, too, in the life of nations there came a time when they began to\n\nfeel themselves more shut off from the divine inspiration of their early\n\nforefathers. Just as the child becomes gradually shut off from the\n\naura that floats about its head in its earliest years, so in the life\n\nof nations did the divine ancestors withdraw themselves more and more,\n\nand mankind was left to its own research and to its own knowledge. When\n\nhistory speaks in this manner, the fact of the guidance of humanity\n\nis realized. “Menes” was the Egyptian name of him who inaugurated the\n\nfirst “human” civilization, and it is at the same time hinted that man\n\nthereby became liable to error, for thenceforward he was left to look\n\nfor guidance to the instrument of his brain. That man was liable to fall\n\ninto error is symbolically indicated by the fixing of the date of the\n\nconstruction of the labyrinth at the time when humanity was abandoned by\n\nthe gods; for the labyrinth is an image of the convolutions of the brain\n\nas the instrument of man’s own thoughts, windings in which the thinker\n\nis able to lose himself. The Orientals called man as a thinking being\n\n“Manas” and Manu stands for the first great thinker. The Greeks called\n\nthe first organizer of the human principle of thought Minos, and with him\n\nis associated the myth of the labyrinth, because it was felt that, since\n\nhis time, mankind had gradually passed from the direct guidance of the\n\ngods to a guidance in which the “ego” feels the influence of the higher\n\nspirit-world in a different way.\n\n\n\nBesides those predecessors of man, the true supermen, who had completed\n\ntheir humanity on the Moon and had become angels, there are, however,\n\nother beings who did not perfect their evolution on the Moon. The\n\nbeings called dhyanic in Oriental mysticism and angelic in Christian\n\nesotericism, consummated their evolution on the ancient Moon, and when\n\nman began his earthly career were already a stage higher than he was.\n\nBut there were other beings who had not finished their evolution on the\n\nancient Moon, any more than the higher categories of Luciferic beings had\n\nfinished theirs. When the earth-state of our planet began, man as we have\n\ndescribed him was not the only being there. He felt also the inspiration\n\nof divinely-spiritual beings; otherwise, like a child, he would have been\n\nunable to progress. Accordingly, besides these childlike human beings,\n\nthere must have been also present on the earth, acting through them,\n\nbeings who had completed their evolution on the Moon. But between these\n\nand man there were yet other beings who had not finished their evolution\n\non the Moon, beings of a higher order than man, because, even as early\n\nas the ancient Moon-period, they might have become angels or dhyanic\n\nbeings. At that time, however, they had not come to full maturity. They\n\nwere angels in a backward state, yet they far out-distanced man as\n\nregards everything which man called his own. Generally speaking, they are\n\nbeings occupying the lowest grade in the ranks of Luciferic spirits. They\n\nhold a middle position between men and angels, and with them begins the\n\nkingdom of Luciferic spirits.\n\n\n\nNow it is extremely easy to get an erroneous idea about these spirits.\n\nWe might ask why did the divine spirits, the vicegerents of good, allow\n\nthem to fall short, and thereby admit the Luciferic principle into\n\nhumanity? And it might further be objected on this ground, that surely\n\nthe good gods turned everything to good. This question is obvious. And\n\nanother misunderstanding which might arise, is expressed in the idea\n\nthat these are “evil” spirits. Both ideas are merely misunderstandings:\n\nfor these spirits are by no means purely “evil,” although the origin of\n\nevil in human nature is due to them, but they stand midway between man\n\nand superman. In a certain way they are more perfect than men. In all\n\nthe qualities which human beings have to acquire for themselves, these\n\nspirits have attained a high standard, and they only differ from man’s\n\npredecessors described above in being able to incarnate in human bodies\n\nwhilst man is being evolved on earth. This is because they did not\n\nconsummate their humanity on the Moon.\n\n\n\nThe dhyanic or angelic beings proper, who are the great inspirers\n\nof humanity, and to whom the Egyptian referred as being still their\n\nteachers, did not appear in human bodies, but could only manifest\n\nthemselves through human beings. On the other hand, the beings in a\n\nmid-position between men and angels were still able, in very early\n\ntimes, to incarnate in human bodies. Hence amongst the human race\n\ninhabiting the earth in the Lemurian and Atlantean periods, we find\n\npeople whose innermost soul-nature was that of an angel in a backward\n\nstate; i.e., in the ancient Lemurian and Atlantean periods, there\n\nwere not only ordinary people going about the earth, who through their\n\nsuccessive incarnations were to arrive at what corresponds to the ideal\n\nof humanity, but beings who only outwardly appeared like the others. They\n\nhad to bear a human body, for the outward form of a human being in the\n\nflesh is dependent on earthly conditions. Especially in the more ancient\n\ntimes did it happen that beings belonging to the lowest category of\n\nLuciferic individualities were present amongst men. And so at the same\n\ntime when the angel-beings were working on human civilization through\n\nman, Lucifer-beings were also incarnated and founding human civilizations\n\nin various places. And when in the old folk-legends it is related that in\n\nsome place there lived a great man who was the founder of a civilization,\n\nwe are not to understand that a Lucifer-being was incarnated who must\n\nnecessarily have been the vehicle of evil, for, on the contrary, human\n\ncivilization received countless blessings through those beings.\n\n\n\nNow it is known through occult science that in ancient times,\n\nparticularly in the Atlantean period, there existed a kind of primitive\n\nhuman language, a manner of speech which was similar all over the\n\nearth, because “speech” in those days came much more out of the depths\n\nof the soul than it does now. This may be gathered from the following:\n\nIn Atlantean times, people felt all outward impressions in such a way\n\nthat if the soul wished to express anything outward by a sound, it\n\nwas constrained to use a consonant. What therefore existed in space\n\npressed for imitation in a consonant. The blowing of the wind, the murmur\n\nof the waves, the shelter given by a house were felt, and imitated by\n\nman in consonants. On the other hand, the sorrow or joy which was felt\n\ninwardly, or even what in another being might be feeling, was imitated\n\nin a vowel. From this we can see that the soul became one, in speech,\n\nwith outer events or beings. The following instance is taken from the\n\nAkashic Records: A man drew near a hut, which was arched in the ancient\n\nfashion and gave shelter and protection to a family. He noticed this, and\n\nexpressed the protective arch by a consonant; and by a vowel he expressed\n\nthe fact, which he was able to feel, that within the hut the souls in\n\nbodies were comfortable. Thence arose the thought, “Shelter.” “There is\n\na shelter for me, shelter for human bodies.” The thought was then poured\n\nforth in consonants and vowels, which could not be otherwise than they\n\nwere, because they were a direct impression of experience and had but one\n\nmeaning. This was the same all over the earth. It is no dream that there\n\nwas once a primitive human root-language. And, in a certain sense, the\n\ninitiates of all nations are still able to feel that language. Indeed\n\nthere are in all languages certain similar sounds which are nothing else\n\nthan the remains of that universal language.\n\n\n\nThis speech was prompted in human souls by the inspiration of the\n\nsuperhuman beings, man’s true predecessors, who had perfected their\n\nevolution on the Moon. From this it may be seen that if that evolution\n\nalone had taken place, the entire human race would practically have\n\nremained one great unity, and there would have been uniformity of speech\n\nand thought all over the earth. Individuality and diversity could not\n\nhave been developed, nor at the same time could human freedom. In\n\norder that man might become individual, cleavages had to take place in\n\nhumanity, and the difference of language in different parts of the world\n\nis due to the work of those teachers in whom a Luciferic spirit was\n\nincarnated. According as a particular angel-being, who had fallen short\n\nin his evolution, was incarnated in a particular race, was he able to\n\ninstruct its people in a particular language. Thus the ability to speak\n\na separate language is, in all races, traceable to the illuminating\n\npresence of these great beings, who were angels in a backward state and\n\nstood far above the people of their immediate environment. For instance,\n\nthe beings described as the original heroes of the Greeks and other\n\nnations, and who worked in a human form, were those in whom an angel who\n\nhad fallen short was incarnated. Therefore these beings must by no means\n\nbe characterized as entirely “evil.” On the contrary, they brought to man\n\nthat which predestined him to be a free human being all over the globe,\n\nand they differentiated what otherwise would have constituted a uniform\n\nwhole everywhere on earth. This is not only true of languages but of many\n\nother departments of life. Individualization, differentiation, freedom,\n\nwe may say, comes from the beings who fell short in their Moon-evolution.\n\nIt is true that we might say that it was the purpose of the wise\n\ngovernment of the cosmos to bring all beings in planetary evolution to\n\ntheir goal, but if this had been done in a direct way, certain things\n\nwould not have been attained. Certain beings were therefore arrested in\n\ntheir development because they were to have a special mission in the\n\nprogress of humanity. Since the beings who had fulfilled their mission\n\non the Moon would only have been able to educate a uniform human race,\n\nbeings who had fallen short on the Moon were set over against them, and\n\nit thereby became possible for these backward ones to turn into good what\n\nhad been really a fault on their part.\n\n\n\nThis opens up the question, why do evil, wickedness, imperfection and\n\ndisease exist in the world? This problem should be looked at from\n\nthe point of view from which we have just considered the imperfect\n\nangel-beings. Everything which at any time exhibits imperfection or\n\nbackwardness will nevertheless be turned into good in the course of\n\nevolution. It is of course unnecessary to mention that such a truth as\n\nthis affords no justification for bad actions on man’s part.\n\n\n\nThus we already have an answer to the question, why does a wise\n\nProvidence allow certain beings to lag behind and not reach their goal?\n\nThis happens just because there will be good reason for it at the time\n\nfollowing upon the formation of such a purpose. For it was when nations\n\nwere not yet able to guide and govern themselves that the teachers\n\nof particular periods and individuals arose. And all the different\n\nrace-teachers, Cadmus, Cheops, Pelops, Theseus, etc., are, in one\n\naspect, angel-beings in the depths of their souls. From this it appears\n\nthat in this respect also, humanity is really subject to direction and\n\nguidance.\n\n\n\nNow at every stage of evolution there are beings who lag behind and do\n\nnot attain the possible goal. Let us then look once more at the ancient\n\nEgyptian civilization, which ran its course thousands of years ago in\n\nthe Nile valley. Superhuman teachers were manifested to the Egyptians,\n\nwho said that these teachers guided mankind like gods. At the same time,\n\nhowever, other beings were also at work, who had only half or partially\n\nattained the angelic stage. Now we must fully understand that in ancient\n\nEgypt man reached a definite stage of evolution, i.e., that the souls\n\nof people of the present day had attained a definite stage in the\n\nEgyptian period. But it is not only man who gains by letting himself be\n\nguided; the beings also who direct and guide him attain thereby something\n\nwhich furthers their evolution. For instance, an angel is something\n\nmore after he has guided humanity for a while, than he was before that\n\nguidance began. His guiding work helps him to progress, and this is true\n\nnot only of one who has completed his evolution as an angel, but also of\n\none who has lagged behind. All beings are able continually to advance;\n\neverything is in a state of perpetual development; but at every stage\n\nbeings are left behind. Thus, in accordance with what has just been\n\nsaid, there can be distinguished in the ancient Egyptian civilization\n\nthe divine leaders or angels, the semi-divine leaders who did not quite\n\nattain the angelic stage, and the men. But certain beings in the ranks\n\nof the angels again lag behind, i.e., they do not bring all their\n\npowers into expression when guiding humanity, but remain behind as angels\n\nduring the ancient Egyptian stage of civilization. Similarly some of the\n\nincomplete angels lag behind. Thus whilst men below were progressing,\n\ncertain individuals of the beings above, the dhyanic spirits or angels,\n\nfell behind in their evolution. When the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization\n\ncame to an end, and the Graeco-Roman period began, certain guiding\n\nspirits from the former period, who had fallen behind in their evolution,\n\nwere present. But they could not use their powers, for other angels or\n\nhalf-angelic beings had replaced them, and that meant that their own\n\nevolution was at a standstill.\n\n\n\nHence there comes under our notice a category of beings who might have\n\nused their powers during the Egyptian period, but did not at that time\n\nuse them fully. In the ensuing Graeco-Roman period they were not able\n\nto use them, because then they were replaced by other guiding spirits,\n\nand all the conditions of that time made their intervention impossible.\n\nBut just as the beings who had not reached the angelic stage on the old\n\nMoon were afterwards allotted the task of once more actively interposing\n\nin human evolution during the earth-period, so also the beings who as\n\nguiding spirits in the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization had stopped short in\n\ntheir development, afterwards received the mission, as beings who had\n\nlagged behind, of again intervening in civilization. Thus we shall be\n\nable to watch a later period of civilization in which beings sent to be\n\nguides are certainly there to direct the normal progress of evolution,\n\nbut in which, at the same time, other beings are intervening who were\n\nleft behind at an earlier stage, and more particularly those who fell\n\nbehind during the ancient Egyptian period. The civilization to which we\n\nare referring is our own. We live at a time when, side by side with the\n\nnormal directors of humanity, others are interposing who were left behind\n\nin the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic period.\n\n\n\nNow we have to look upon the evolution of events and beings in such a\n\nway that occurrences in the physical world must be considered only as\n\neffects or manifestations, the true causes of which are to be sought in\n\nthe spiritual world. On the one hand our civilization is in the main\n\nmarked by an upward movement towards spirituality, and this tendency\n\nof certain people towards spirituality is the manifestation of the\n\nspiritual directors of our contemporary humanity, who have attained\n\ntheir own normal stage of development. In everything which tends to\n\nlead man up to the great spiritual wisdom-truths transmitted to us by\n\ntheosophy, these normal guides of our evolution are manifested. But the\n\nbeings out-distanced during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization are also\n\naffecting the tendencies of our age. They are manifested in much that is\n\nbeing thought and done at the present time, and will again be manifested\n\nin what lies in the near future. They are revealed in everything which\n\ngives a materialistic stamp to our civilization, and may often be seen\n\neven in aspirations after spiritual things. In our age we are virtually\n\nexperiencing a revival of Egyptian civilization. The beings who are to\n\nbe looked upon as the invisible directors of what takes place in the\n\nphysical world, fall accordingly into two classes. The first includes\n\nthose spiritual individualities who have passed through their own normal\n\ncourse of development up to the present time. Hence they were able to\n\ninterpose in the guidance of our civilization, whilst the directors of\n\nthe preceding Graeco-Roman period were gradually finishing their task\n\nof guiding civilization during the first thousand years of Christianity.\n\nThe second class, who work simultaneously with the first class of beings,\n\nare spiritual individualities who did not complete their evolution\n\nduring the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. They were obliged to remain\n\ninactive during the ensuing Graeco-Roman period, but are now able to\n\nresume their activity because our present age has points of resemblance\n\nto the Egypto-Chaldæic period. It thus comes about that many things\n\narise in contemporary humanity which look like a revival of ancient\n\nEgyptian forces, but there is also much which is like a materialistic\n\nresuscitation of forces which then worked spiritually. To illustrate\n\nthis, we may point to an example of the way in which ancient Egyptian\n\nknowledge has been revived in our days.\n\n\n\nLet us think of Kepler. He was quite possessed by the feeling of the\n\nharmony of the cosmos, and this idea was expressed in his important\n\nmathematical laws of the mechanism of the heavens, the so-called laws of\n\nKepler. These are outwardly very dry and abstruse, but in Kepler they\n\nwere the outcome of an understanding of the harmony of the universe. We\n\nmay read in Kepler’s writings that in order to discover what he did,\n\nhe was obliged to go to the sacred Egyptian mysteries, purloin their\n\ntemple-vessels, and by this means bring knowledge into the world, the\n\nimportance of which to humanity would only be known in later times.\n\n\n\nThis utterance of Kepler’s is by no means an empty phrase, but contains\n\na dim consciousness of a revival of what he had learned in the Egyptian\n\nperiod, during a former incarnation. We may certainly entertain the\n\nidea that Kepler assimilated the ancient Egyptian wisdom during one of\n\nhis previous lives, and that it reappears in his soul in a new form,\n\nadapted to a later age. That a materialistic impulse should enter our\n\ncivilization through the Egyptian spirit is quite intelligible, for\n\nEgyptian spirituality was wrapped in a vigorous materialism, which found\n\nexpression, for instance, in their embalming the physical bodies of the\n\ndead. This meant that they attached value to the preservation of the\n\nphysical body. This has come down to us from the Egyptian period in a\n\ndifferent form, but in one corresponding to our time. The same forces\n\nwhich had not then run their course, affect our age, but in a different\n\nway. The temper of mind which embalmed dead bodies gave rise to that\n\nwhich idolizes the merely material. The Egyptian embalmed dead bodies\n\nand thereby preserved what he accounted valuable. He thought that the\n\ndevelopment of the soul after death was connected with the preservation\n\nof the physical, material body. The modern anatomist dissects what he\n\nsees, and thinks that in this way he understands the laws of the human\n\norganism. Thus in our modern science there are living the forces of\n\nthe ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic world, which then were progressive\n\nforces, but which now represent what has lagged behind, and which must\n\nbe recognized for what they are, if a correct estimate is to be formed\n\nof the character of the present time. These forces will injure a man of\n\nthe present day if he does not know their real significance. He will take\n\nno harm from them, but will turn them to good account, if he knows their\n\neffect and thereby brings himself into the right relation to them. They\n\nhave their value, for without them we should not have the present great\n\nachievements in technique, industries, etc. They are forces belonging to\n\nLuciferic beings of the lowest stage, and the danger lies in the fact\n\nthat if they are not recognized aright, the materialistic impulses of\n\nthe present time are thought to be the only possible ones, and the other\n\nforces, which lead up to the spiritual world, are not seen. For this\n\nreason any clear diagnosis is certain to discern two currents of thought\n\nin the present age.\n\n\n\nNow if a wise Providence had not allowed certain beings in the\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic period to fall short in their evolution, our contemporary\n\ncivilization would have been wanting in necessary weight. In that\n\ncase only those forces would be operative which would bring man into\n\nthe spiritual world by main force. People would be only too ready to\n\nyield themselves up to those forces, and would become dreamers. The\n\nonly life they would wish to know about would be one which is being\n\nspiritualized as fast as possible, and their standard of action would\n\nbe a view of life which showed a certain degree of contempt for what is\n\nphysical and material. But the present epoch of civilization can only\n\nfulfill its mission if the forces of the material world are brought\n\nto the fullest perfection, and if thus by degrees their sphere too is\n\nwon for spirituality. Just as the fairest things may become corrupters\n\nand tempters of mankind if pursued in a one-sided way, so if this\n\none-sidedness took root, there would be great danger that all kinds of\n\ngood efforts would come into manifestation as fanaticism. True though\n\nit is that humanity is helped forward by its noble impulses it is also\n\ntrue that wild and fanatical advocacy of the noblest impulses may bring\n\nabout the worst of results as far as true evolution is concerned. Only\n\nwhen people strive after the highest modestly and sensibly, not out of\n\nwild fanaticism, can anything beneficial to the progress of humanity take\n\nplace. In order that the work done on earth at the present day may have\n\nthe necessary weight, and that material beings of the physical plane may\n\nbe understood, the wisdom which directs the government of the world left\n\nthose forces behind which would normally have completed their evolution\n\nduring the Egyptian period; and it is they who are now directing man’s\n\nattention to physical life.\n\n\n\nIt is obvious from the foregoing that evolution takes place under the\n\ninfluence both of normally progressive beings and of those who lag\n\nbehind. Clairvoyant vision is able to trace the co-operation of both\n\nclasses of beings in the supersensible world, and hence is able to\n\ncomprehend the spiritual events of which the physical facts surrounding\n\nhumanity are the manifestations.\n\n\n\nWe observe that, in order to understand cosmic events, it is not enough\n\nto have spiritual eyes and ears opened to the spiritual world by some\n\nkind of exercise. This only means that we see what is there, that we\n\nare cognizant of spiritual beings and know that they are entities of\n\nthe soul-world or spirit-sphere. But it is also necessary to recognize\n\nwhat kinds of beings they are. We may meet some being of the soul or\n\nspirit world, but we do not necessarily know whether it is progressing\n\nin its evolution, or whether it belongs to the category of powers that\n\nhave lagged behind; whether therefore it is pushing evolution onwards,\n\nor hindering it. Those people who acquire clairvoyant faculties and do\n\nnot at the same time gain complete understanding of the conditions of\n\nhuman evolution which we have described may know absolutely nothing\n\nof the nature of the beings whom they meet. Mere clairvoyance must be\n\nsupplemented by clear judgment of what is seen in the supersensible\n\nworld. There is urgent necessity for this especially in our own time, but\n\nit had not always to be so much considered. If we go back to very ancient\n\ncivilizations, we find different conditions. If in the most ancient\n\nEgyptian times a person was clairvoyant, and was confronted with a being\n\nfrom the supersensible world, the latter had, as it were, written on his\n\nforehead who he was. The clairvoyant could not mistake him. Now, however,\n\nthe possibility of misunderstanding is very great. Whereas humanity\n\nin early times still stood very near the kingdom of the spiritual\n\nhierarchies and could see what beings it was meeting, it is now very easy\n\nto be mistaken, and the only protection against being severely injured is\n\nthe effort to gain ideas and conceptions like those indicated above.\n\n\n\nA person who is able to look into the spiritual world is called\n\nesoterically a “clairvoyant,” but merely to be clairvoyant is not\n\nenough, for such a man might be able to see well enough but not able to\n\ndiscriminate. He who has acquired the faculty of distinguishing one from\n\nanother the beings and events of higher worlds, is called an “Initiate.”\n\nInitiation brings with it the possibility of distinguishing between\n\ndifferent kinds of beings. Thus it is possible to be clairvoyant in the\n\nhigher worlds without being an Initiate. In ancient times distinguishing\n\nbetween spirits was not specially important, for when the ancient occult\n\nschools had brought a pupil so far as clairvoyance, there was no great\n\ndanger of error. Now, however, this danger exists to a high degree.\n\nTherefore in all esoteric training, care should be taken that initiation\n\nshould be acquired in condition to clairvoyance. In proportion to the\n\nextent of his clairvoyance must a man become capable of distinguishing\n\nbetween the various kinds of supersensible beings and events.\n\n\n\nIn modern times the powers guiding humanity are faced by the special task\n\nof bringing about a balance between the two principles of clairvoyance\n\nand initiation. Leaders of spiritual training had necessarily to pay\n\nattention to this at the beginning of the modern era. Therefore the\n\nesoteric spiritual movement which is adapted to present conditions,\n\nalways makes a point of maintaining the right proportion between\n\nclairvoyance and initiation. This became necessary at the time when\n\nmankind was passing through a crisis with regard to its higher knowledge.\n\nThat time was the thirteenth century. About the year 1250 was the point\n\nof time when mankind felt itself most shut out from the spiritual world.\n\nA clairvoyant looking back upon that period sees the following: The most\n\neminent minds of that time who were striving after some kind of higher\n\nknowledge, could only say to themselves, “What our reason, our intellect,\n\nour spiritual knowledge are able to find out is limited to the physical\n\nworld around us. With all our human endeavor and power of perception,\n\nwe cannot reach a spiritual world. We only know of it by accepting the\n\ninformation concerning it which our forefathers bequeathed us.” This was\n\nthe time when direct view of the higher worlds was obscured. That this\n\ncan be said of the era in which scholasticism flourished, is not without\n\nsignificance.\n\n\n\nAbout the year 1250 was the time when men were compelled to fix a\n\nboundary between what they were able to apprehend for themselves,\n\nand what they had to believe from the impression made upon them by\n\nthe traditions which had been handed down. What they could find out\n\nfor themselves then became limited to the physical world of sense.\n\nAfterwards, however, came the time when there was more and more\n\npossibility of again winning a view of the spiritual world. But the\n\nnew clairvoyance was of a different kind from the old, which virtually\n\nbecame extinct just about the year 1250. In the new form of clairvoyance,\n\nwestern esotericism was obliged strictly to uphold the principle that\n\ninitiation must be the guide of spiritual sight and hearing. This was\n\nthe special task assigned to an esoteric current which then entered the\n\nstream of European civilization. As the year 1250 drew near there arose a\n\nnew kind of guidance into the supersensible worlds.\n\n\n\nThis guidance was prepared by the spirits then standing behind outer\n\nhistorical events, who centuries before had provided for the kind of\n\nesoteric training which would be rendered necessary by the conditions\n\nprevailing in 1250. If the term “modern esotericism” be not misused,\n\nit may be applied to the spiritual work of those very highly evolved\n\npersonalities. External history knows nothing of them, but what they did\n\nis apparent in every form of civilization which has developed since the\n\nthirteenth century.\n\n\n\nThe importance of the year 1250 for the spiritual evolution of humanity\n\nis specially apparent if we look at the result of clairvoyant research\n\ngiven in the following fact: Even those individualities who had attained\n\nhigh stages of spiritual development, in previous incarnations, and who\n\nwere reincarnated about 1250, were compelled for a while to undergo a\n\ncomplete clouding over of their direct view of the spiritual world.\n\nQuite enlightened individuals were as though cut off from the spiritual\n\nworld, and their only knowledge of it was through their remembrance of\n\nearlier incarnations. Thus we see how necessary it was that from that\n\ntime onwards a new element should be brought into the spiritual guidance\n\nof humanity. This element was true modern esotericism. By its means it is\n\nfor the first time possible rightly to understand how that which we call\n\nthe “Christ-impulse” may intervene to guide the whole of mankind and the\n\nindividual also, in all possible eventualities.\n\n\n\nBetween the accomplishment of the Mystery of Golgotha and the beginnings\n\nof modern esotericism, lies the first period of the working of the\n\nChrist-principle in human souls. During that period, people received\n\nChrist to a certain degree unconsciously as far as their higher\n\nspirit-forces were concerned, and this caused them afterwards, when\n\nthey were obliged to receive them consciously, to make all kinds of\n\nmistakes, and to lose themselves in a maze instead of understanding\n\nChrist. In primitive Christian times we may trace the adoption of the\n\nChrist-principle by the lower soul-forces. Then came a new period, in\n\nwhich mankind of to-day is still living. Indeed, in a certain respect,\n\npeople are only now beginning to understand the Christ principle with\n\nthe higher faculties of their souls. In the further course of this work\n\nit will be shown that the decline of supersensible knowledge down to the\n\nthirteenth century, and on the other hand its slow revival since that\n\ntime, coincide with the interposition of the Christ-impulse in human\n\nevolution.\n\n\n\nWe may therefore take modern esotericism to mean the raising of the\n\nChrist-impulse to be the motive power in the guidance of souls desiring\n\nto work their way to a knowledge of higher worlds, in accordance with the\n\nevolutionary conditions of modern times.\n\n\n\n= LECTURE III\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with what has been said in the preceding chapters, the\n\nspiritual guidance of the course of human evolution may be sought for\n\namong those beings who went through their stage of humanity during the\n\nprevious embodiment of the Earth-planet, i.e., during the ancient Moon\n\nperiod. This guidance stood contrasted with another which checked, and\n\nyet in a certain sense furthered, whilst checking the first, and which\n\nwas carried out by those beings who had not completed their own evolution\n\nduring the Moon-period. Reference is made in both these cases to those\n\nguiding beings immediately above man to those who lead humanity forward,\n\nand to those who provoke resistance, thereby strengthening and confirming\n\nthe forces arising through the progressive beings, by bestowing on them\n\nbalance and individuality. In Christian Esotericism, these two classes of\n\nsuperhuman beings are called Angels (Angeloi). Above these beings in an\n\nascending order, stand those of the higher hierarchies, the Archangels,\n\nthe Archai, etc., who likewise take part in the guidance of humanity.\n\n\n\nWithin the ranks of these different beings there are all possible\n\ngradations in regard to perfection. In the category of the Angels there\n\nare at the beginning of the present Earth-evolution, some standing\n\nhigh and others less developed. The former have progressed far beyond\n\nthe minimum of their Moon-development. Between these and those who had\n\njust reached this minimum when the Moon-evolution had come to an end,\n\nand the Earth-evolution had begun, there are all possible gradations.\n\nConformably with this gradation of rank, the beings in question entered\n\nduring the Earth-period upon the leadership of human evolution. Thus the\n\nevolution of the Egyptian civilization was effected under the guidance\n\nof beings who had become more perfected on the Moon than those who were\n\nthe leaders of the Graeco-Roman period, and these again were more perfect\n\nthan those who have the leadership at the present time. In the Egyptian\n\nas also in the Greek Period, those who later on assumed the direction,\n\nwere meanwhile developing, and making themselves ready to guide the\n\ncivilization of later periods.\n\n\n\nSince the time of the great Atlantean catastrophe, seven consecutive\n\nepochs of civilization have to be differentiated; the first is the\n\nancient Indian epoch, and it is followed by the ancient Persian.[2]\n\nThe third is the Egypto-Chaldæic, the fourth is the Graeco-Roman,\n\nand the fifth is our own, which, since about the twelfth century, has\n\nbeen gradually developing and in which we are still living. And as the\n\nseparate periods overlap, we see already in our times those early events\n\npreparing which will lead over into the sixth post-Atlantean epoch. And a\n\nseventh epoch will succeed the sixth in due course. On closer observation\n\nwe find the following evidence with regard to the guidance of mankind.\n\nIt was during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic, that\n\nthe Angels (or lower dhyanic beings according to Oriental mysticism)\n\nwere to some extent independent leaders of humanity. They were not so\n\nduring the ancient Persian civilization. For then they were subject to\n\na higher direction in a much greater degree than in the Egyptian times,\n\nand had to regulate everything in conformity with the impulses of the\n\nhierarchies immediately above them. In this way everything was under the\n\nimmediate guidance of the Angels, but these themselves submitted to the\n\nrulership of the Archangels. And in the Indian epoch when post-Atlantean\n\nlife had reached such a height in spiritual matters as has never been\n\nattained since a natural height under the direction of great human\n\nteachers then the Archangels themselves were subject in a similar sense\n\nto the guidance of the Archai or Primal Powers. Thus if we trace the\n\nevolution of humanity from the Indian epoch through the ancient Persian\n\nand Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, we may say that certain beings of the\n\nhigher hierarchies withdrew as it were, ever more and more from the\n\ndirect guidance of humanity. And in the fourth post-Atlantean period of\n\ncivilization, i.e., the Graeco-Roman epoch, man had become in a certain\n\nsense quite independent. The guiding superhuman beings were certainly\n\nintervening to develop humanity, but only in such a way that the reins\n\nwere tightened as little as possible, and also that the spiritual leaders\n\nthemselves might profit as much through the deeds of men as men profited\n\nthrough them. Hence arose that peculiar and quite “human” civilization in\n\nthe Graeco-Roman time in which man was made to rely entirely on himself.\n\nFor all the distinctive characteristics of Art and political life in\n\nGreek and Roman times are traceable to the fact that man had to live out\n\nhis own life in his own way.\n\n\n\nSo, when we look back to the most ancient times of civilization, we then\n\nfind evolution guided by beings who had accomplished their evolution\n\nas far as the human stage, in earlier planetary conditions. But the\n\nfourth post-Atlantean period of civilization was intended as a time\n\nwhen man should be put to the test as much as possible, and consequently\n\nwas the time when the whole spiritual guidance of humanity had to be\n\nre-organized. We are now living in the fifth post-Atlantean period of\n\ncivilization. The leading beings of this period belong to the same\n\nhierarchy as that which ruled the ancient Egyptians and Chaldæans. In\n\nfact those beings who then took the lead, have again begun to be active\n\nin our times, for it has been stated that certain beings remained behind\n\nduring the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, and that these are to be found\n\nmanifested in the materialistic feelings and perceptions of our own\n\nperiod.\n\n\n\nNow the progress made by the beings of each class of Angels or lower\n\ndhyanic beings the class which leads mankind forward and the class which\n\nobstructs consists in their being able to be leaders among the Egyptians\n\nand Chaldæans by means of those qualities which they had acquired in\n\nprimordial times, and which they had further developed by their work as\n\nleaders. Thus the progressive Angels are intervening to guide the fifth\n\npost-Atlantean civilization by means of capacities which they themselves\n\nhad won during the third or Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. Through the\n\nprogress they make they are acquiring for themselves quite special\n\ncapabilities, for they are qualifying themselves to receive the influx\n\nof forces emanating from the most important Being in the whole evolution\n\nof the Earth. The power of the Christ is working in them; for that power\n\nworks not only on the physical world through Jesus of Nazareth but also\n\nin the spiritual worlds upon the superhuman beings. The Christ exists\n\nnot only for the earth but also for these other beings. The beings who\n\nguided the old Egypto-Chaldæic civilization were not at that time under\n\nthe direction of the Christ, but have only placed themselves under His\n\nguidance since. And their progress consists in their following Him in the\n\nhigher worlds, so that they may guide our fifth post-Atlantean period of\n\ncivilization in accordance with His influence. And the remaining behind\n\nof those beings of whom it has been said that they operate as obstructive\n\npowers, is due to their not having put themselves under the leadership of\n\nthe Christ, and thus they continue to work independently of Him. Hence\n\nthe following state of things will become more and more evident in human\n\nevolution: There will be a materialistic movement under the guidance\n\nof the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits. It will have a materialistic\n\ncharacter, and the greater part of what in all countries, may be called\n\ncontemporary materialistic science is under this influence. There\n\nare, for example, people to-day who say that our earth in its primary\n\norigin consisted of atoms. Who instils this thought into men’s minds?\n\nIt is the superhuman angel beings who had remained behind during the\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic period. But, side by side with this movement, there\n\nis another making itself felt, the one which has as its goal that man\n\nshall eventually find in all that he does, that which may be called the\n\nChrist-principle.\n\n\n\nNow what will those beings teach who attained their goal in the old\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic sphere of civilization, and who then learned to know\n\nthe Christ? They will be able to instill into man other thoughts than\n\nthat there are only material atoms; for they will be able to teach that,\n\neven to the minutest particle of the world, the substance is permeated\n\nwith the Spirit of the Christ. And, strange as it may seem, there will\n\nbe in the future, chemists and physicists who will not teach chemistry\n\nand physics as they are now taught under the influence of the backward\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic spirits; but who will teach that “Matter is built up\n\nin the way in which the Christ gradually ordained it.” The Christ will\n\nbe found working even in the very laws of chemistry and physics. It is\n\na spiritual chemistry, and spiritual physics that will come in the\n\nfuture. To-day such a statement appears certainly to many people as\n\nsomething fanciful or worse than that, but in many cases the sense of the\n\nfuture is folly to the past. The factors which in this sense enter into\n\nthe evolution of human civilization are already there for the careful\n\nobserver; but such an one will know quite well the objections which may,\n\nwith apparent justice, be urged against such alleged folly from the\n\nmodern scientific or philosophic point of view.\n\n\n\nFrom such hypotheses we are able to understand what advantage the guiding\n\nsuperhuman beings have compared with man. Humanity learned to know Christ\n\nin the fourth civilization period of the post-Atlantean times, i.e.,\n\nin the Graeco-Roman epoch, for it was in the course of this civilization\n\nthat the Christ-event found its place in evolution, and it was then\n\nthat man learned to know the Christ. The guiding superhuman beings,\n\nhowever, learned to know Him during the Egypto-Chaldæic times, and worked\n\nthemselves up to Him. Then during the Graeco-Roman civilization they had\n\nto leave man to his own fate in order that, later on, they might re-enter\n\nthe sphere of human evolution. And if nowadays theosophy is cultivated,\n\nthat signifies nothing else than a recognition of the fact that the\n\nsuperhuman beings who formerly guided humanity are now continuing their\n\ntask as leaders in such a way as to be under the direct guidance of the\n\nChrist themselves. Thus it is with other beings also.\n\n\n\nIn the ancient Persian epoch, the leadership of humanity was apportioned\n\nto the Archangels. They put themselves under the direction of the Christ\n\nearlier than did the beings in the rank next below them. Of Zarathustra\n\nit can be said that pointing to the sun, he spoke to his followers and\n\nhis people in some such words as these: “In the sun there lives the\n\ngreat Spirit Ahura Mazdao, who will one day come down to the earth.” For\n\nthe beings out of the region of the Archangels who guided Zarathustra,\n\npointed to the great sun-leader, who had not at that time come down upon\n\nthe earth, but had only begun his journey thither in order, later on,\n\nto enter directly into the earth evolution. And the guiding beings who\n\ndirected the great teachers of the Indians, also pointed these to the\n\nChrist of the future; for it is a mistake to think that these teachers\n\nhad no foreknowledge of the Christ. They said that He was “beyond their\n\nsphere” and that they “could not attain” unto Him.\n\n\n\nAs now in our fifth period of civilization, it is the Angels who bring\n\ndown the Christ into our spiritual evolution, so the sixth period of\n\ncivilization will be directed by beings who belong to the ranks of the\n\nArchangels who guided the ancient Persian civilization. And spirits of\n\nPersonality the Primal Powers or Archai who guided humanity during the\n\nancient Indian epoch will have to guide humanity in the seventh period\n\nof civilization. In the Graeco-Roman period, the Christ descended from\n\nthe heights of the spirit-world and revealed Himself in the physical body\n\nof Jesus of Nazareth. He then came down as far as the physical world. It\n\nwill be possible to find Him in the world immediately above ours when\n\nhumanity shall have become sufficiently ripe. It will not be possible\n\nin the future to find Him in the physical world, but only in the world\n\nimmediately above, for human beings will not always remain the same; they\n\nwill become more mature, and will then find the Christ in the spiritual\n\nworld, as Paul found Him in his experience before Damascus, which event\n\nprophetically foreshadowed the future means of finding the Christ. And\n\nsince in our times the same great teachers who have already guided\n\nmankind through the Egyptian Civilization are working, so also in the\n\ntwentieth century it will be these same teachers who will lead men out\n\nto behold the Christ as Paul beheld Him. They will show mankind how the\n\nChrist not only works upon the earth, but how He spiritualizes the whole\n\nsolar system. And those who will be the reincarnated holy teachers of\n\nIndia in the seventh period of civilization will proclaim the Spirit Who\n\nwas foreshadowed through the undivided Brahma, to whom however the right\n\ncontent and meaning could only be given through the Christ, as the great,\n\nthe immense Spirit, of Whom they formerly said that He hovered above\n\ntheir sphere. Thus will humanity be led upwards from stage to stage into\n\nthe spiritual world.\n\n\n\nTo speak in this way about the Christ how He is the leader of the higher\n\nhierarchies also in the successive worlds, is to teach the science which,\n\nunder the title of modern esotericism, has endured into our civilization\n\nsince the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and which, as has been shown,\n\nhad from that time become necessary. If from this aspect we observe more\n\nclosely the Being Who lived in Palestine, and Who consummated the Mystery\n\nof Golgotha, then we find the following:\n\n\n\nUp to the present time many ideas concerning the Christ have found\n\nexpression. There was for instance the idea of certain Christian Gnostics\n\nin the first centuries, who said that the Christ Who lives in Palestine\n\nwas not present in any physical body of flesh at all; that He had only an\n\napparent body an etheric body which had become physically visible; so\n\nthat His death on the Cross had been no real death but only an apparent\n\none, for the very reason that only an etheric body was present. Then we\n\nfind the various disputes among those who professed Christianity, as for\n\nexample, the well-known controversy between the Arians and Athenatians,\n\netc., and the most varied explanations concerning what the Christ really\n\nwas. And indeed right up to our own times people express and have\n\nexpressed the most varied ideas concerning the Christ.\n\n\n\nNow spiritual science must recognize in Christ not merely an earthly but\n\nalso a cosmic Being. In a certain sense man is, taken as a whole, a\n\ncosmic being. He lives a twofold life one in a physical body from birth\n\nto death, another in the spiritual worlds between death and a new birth.\n\nWhen he is incarnated in a physical body, he is living in dependence on\n\nthe earth, because the physical body is restricted by the forces and\n\nconditions of existence belonging to the earth. A man, however, does not\n\nonly take the substances and forces of the earth into himself, but is\n\njoined to the whole of the earth’s organism. When he has passed through\n\nthe gate of death, he does not any longer belong to the forces of the\n\nearth; but it would be incorrect to imagine that he then belongs to no\n\nforces at all, for he is then connected with the forces of the solar\n\nsystem and the more distant star-systems. In this way, between death\n\nand a new birth, he lives in the domain of the cosmic, just as in the\n\nperiod between birth and death he lived in the domain of the earthly.\n\nFrom death to a new birth he belongs to the cosmos, as on the earth he\n\nbelongs to the elements Air, Water, and Earth. Accordingly, while he\n\nis passing through a life between death and a new birth, he comes into\n\nthe region of cosmic influences, for the planets send forth not merely\n\nthe physical forces of what astronomy teaches, such as gravitation and\n\nothers, but also spiritual forces, and with these spiritual powers of the\n\ncosmos man is connected each person in a special manner according to\n\nhis own individuality. If he is born in Europe, he lives in a different\n\nrelation to warmth conditions, etc., than if he had been born, let us\n\nsay, in Australia. Similarly, during his life between death and a new\n\nbirth, one person may stand more closely related to the spiritual powers\n\nof Mars, another to those of Jupiter, others again to those of the whole\n\nplanetary system in general, and so on. It is also these forces which\n\nbring man back again to the earth. Thus before he is born he is living in\n\nconnection with the collective whole of stellar space.\n\n\n\nAccording to the way in which a man stands individually related to the\n\ncosmic system, so are the forces directed which lead him to this or that\n\nset of parents and to this or that locality. The impetus, the inclination\n\nto incarnate here or there, in this or that family, in this or that\n\npeople, at this or that time, depends on how the person was organically\n\nconnected with the cosmic before birth. In former times, in that\n\nterritory where the German tongue was spoken, a specially apt expression\n\nwas used whereby to indicate a person’s entrance into the world through\n\nbirth. When a person was born, people said that in such and such a place\n\nhe had “become young” (jung-geworden). Therein lies an unconscious\n\nreference to the fact that man in the time between death and a new birth\n\ncontinues at first to be subject to the powers which had made him old in\n\na previous incarnation, but that before birth there come in their place\n\nsuch forces as again make him “young.” Thus Goethe in “Faust” still uses\n\nthe expression “to become young in Nebelland” Nebelland being the old\n\nname for mediæval Germany.\n\n\n\nThe truth underlying the casting of a horoscope is that those who know\n\nthese things can read the forces which determine a person’s physical\n\nexistence. A certain horoscope is allotted to a person because, within\n\nit, those forces find expression which have led him into being. If,\n\nfor example, in the horoscope, Mars stands over Aries (the Ram) that\n\nsignifies that certain of the Aries forces are not allowed to pass\n\nthrough Mars and are weakened. Thus is a man put into his place within\n\nphysical existence, and it is in accordance with his horoscope that he\n\nguides himself before entering upon earthly existence. This subject,\n\nwhich in our times seems so much a thing of chance should not be\n\ntouched upon without our attention being called to the fact that nearly\n\neverything practiced in this connection to-day is simply dilettantism a\n\npure superstition and that for the external world the true science of\n\nthese matters has been for the most part completely lost. Consequently,\n\nthe principal things which have been said here are not to be judged\n\naccording to that which nowadays frequently leads a questionable\n\nexistence under the name of Astrology.\n\n\n\nNow it is the active forces of the stellar world that impel man into\n\nphysical incarnation; and when clairvoyant consciousness observes a\n\nperson, it can perceive in his organization how this has resulted from\n\nthe co-operation of cosmic forces. We may now attempt to illustrate this\n\nhypothetically, but in a form corresponding entirely with clairvoyant\n\nobservations: If a person’s physical brain were extracted and its\n\nconstruction clairvoyantly examined, so that it might be seen how certain\n\nparts are situated in certain places, and send out appendages, it would\n\nbe found that the brain of each individual is different. No two people\n\nhave brains alike. Then let us imagine further that this brain could be\n\nphotographed in its complete structure so that one would have a kind\n\nof half-sphere in which every detail was visible, then this would make\n\na different picture in the case of each person. And if one were to\n\nphotograph a person’s brain at the moment of birth and then photograph\n\nalso the heavens lying exactly over the person’s birthplace, then this\n\nlatter picture would be of exactly the same appearance as that of the\n\nhuman brain.\n\n\n\nAs certain centres were arranged in the latter, so would the stars be\n\nin the photograph of the heavens. Man has within himself a picture of\n\nthe heavens, and every man has a different one, according to whether he\n\nwas born in this place or that, and at this or that time. This is one\n\nindication that man is born from out of the whole cosmos.\n\n\n\nWhen we keep this clearly in view we can rise to the idea of how the\n\nmacrocosm manifests itself in each separate individual, and then,\n\nstarting from this point, we can attain a conception of how it showed\n\nitself in the Christ. But if we were to imagine the Christ after the\n\nBaptism of John as though the macrocosm had then been living in Him in\n\nthe same way as in other people, we should be mistaken.\n\n\n\nLet us first consider Jesus of Nazareth: His conditions of existence\n\nwere quite exceptional. At the beginning of our era two boys were born\n\nand named Jesus. The one came through the Nathan line of the house of\n\nDavid, and the other through the Solomon line of the same house. These\n\ntwo children were not born quite at the same time, but nearly so. In\n\nthe Jesus descended from Solomon, Who is described in the Gospel of St.\n\nMatthew, there was incarnated the same individuality who had formerly\n\nlived on the earth as Zarathustra, so that in this Child Jesus there\n\nappears the reincarnated Zarathustra or Zoroaster. The individuality\n\nof Zarathustra grew up in this Child until, as St. Matthew says, His\n\ntwelfth year. In that year, Zarathustra left the body of this Child and\n\npassed over into that of the other Child Jesus Whom the Gospel of St.\n\nLuke describes. In consequence of this the latter child became suddenly\n\nquite different. The parents were astonished when they found Him in\n\nJerusalem in the temple after the spirit of Zarathustra had entered into\n\nHim. This is intimated when it is said that the Child after having been\n\nlost and found again in the temple, so spake that his parents did not\n\nrecognize Him. They only knew Him the Child descended from Nathan as\n\nHe had been before up to this time. But when He began to reason with\n\nthe doctors in the temple, it was possible for Him to speak as He did\n\nbecause the spirit of Zarathustra had come into Him. Until the thirtieth\n\nyear did the spirit of Zarathustra live in the Jesus who was descended\n\nfrom the Nathan line of the house of David. In this body He ripened to a\n\nstill higher perfection. The remark must here be added that as regards\n\nthis personality in which the spirit of Zarathustra now lived, an\n\nextraordinary feature was, that from the spiritual worlds the Buddha\n\nrayed forth his impulses into its astral body.\n\n\n\nThe oriental tradition is correct which says that the Buddha was born as\n\na “Bodhisatva,” and only during his time on earth, in his twenty-ninth\n\nyear, rose to the dignity of a Buddha. When the Gautama Buddha was a\n\nlittle child, the Indian sage Asita came weeping into the royal palace\n\nof his father, Suddhodana. He wept because, as a seer, he knew that\n\nthis King’s son would become the Buddha, and because as an old man, he\n\nfelt that he would no longer be living to see that event take place.\n\nNow this sage was born again in the time of Jesus of Nazareth. It is he\n\nwho is brought before us in the Gospel of St. Luke as the priest of the\n\ntemple who saw the revelation of the Buddha in the Child Jesus descended\n\nfrom Nathan. And seeing this he was able to say: “Lord, now lettest Thou\n\nThy servant depart in peace for I have seen my Master.” What he had not\n\nbeen able to see previously in India, he saw through the astral body of\n\nthe Boy Jesus, Who comes before us in St. Luke’s Gospel, the Bodhisatva\n\nbecome a Buddha.\n\n\n\nAll this was necessary in order that that body might be produced which\n\nreceived the baptism of St. John in the Jordan. At that moment the\n\nindividuality of Zarathustra left the threefold body, the physical,\n\nthe etheric and the astral body of that Jesus Who had grown up in so\n\ncomplicated a manner, in order that the spirit of Zarathustra might be\n\nable to dwell in Him. Through two possibilities of development which\n\nwere given in the two Jesus-Children, the reincarnated Zarathustra had\n\nto pass, and thus there stood before the Baptist the body of Jesus\n\nof Nazareth and in it from that time onwards there acted the cosmic\n\nindividuality of the Christ. Now, as we have shown, in the case of any\n\nother human being, the cosmic spiritual laws work upon him only in so far\n\nthat they give him a start in earth-life. Afterwards there appear in\n\nopposition to these laws, others which arise out of the conditions of the\n\nearth-evolution. In the case of the Christ Jesus, after the baptism of\n\nJohn the cosmic-spiritual forces alone remained effective without being\n\ninfluenced in any way through the laws of the earth evolution.\n\n\n\nThus in Palestine during the time that Jesus of Nazareth walked on\n\nearth as Christ-Jesus, during the three last years of his life, from\n\nhis thirtieth to his thirty-third year, the entire Being of the cosmic\n\nChrist was acting uninterruptedly upon Him, and was working into Him.\n\nThe Christ stood always under the influence of the entire cosmos He\n\nmade no step without this working of the cosmic forces into and in\n\nHim. That which here took place in Jesus of Nazareth was a continual\n\nrealization of the horoscope, for at every moment there occurred that\n\nwhich otherwise happens only at a person’s birth. This could be so only\n\nbecause the whole body of Jesus descended from Nathan had remained open\n\nto the influence of the sum total of the forces of the cosmic spiritual\n\nhierarchies which direct our earth. If thus the whole spirit of the\n\ncosmos worked into the Christ Jesus, who was it that went, for example,\n\nto Capernaum or anywhere else? He who went about as a being upon the\n\nearth appeared quite like any other man. The forces active within Him,\n\nhowever, were the cosmic forces, coming from the sun and stars; and these\n\ndirected His body. And it was always in accordance with the collective\n\nBeing of the whole Universe with whom the earth is in harmony, that all\n\nwhich the Christ Jesus did took place. It is because of this that in\n\nthe case of the acts of the Christ Jesus there is so often some slight\n\nhint given in the Gospels, about the relative grouping of the stars at\n\nthe time. We read in St. John’s Gospel how the Christ finds His first\n\ndisciples. There we are told: “It was about the tenth hour,” because in\n\nthis fact the spirit of the whole cosmos found expression in conformity\n\nwith the appointed moment of time. Such intimations are less clear in\n\nthe other Gospel passages, but he who can truly read the Gospel finds\n\nthem everywhere. From this point of view also the miracles are to be\n\njudged. Let us take one passage, The one that runs thus: “When the sun\n\nwas set, they brought the sick unto Him, and He healed them.” What does\n\nthat mean? The evangelist is drawing attention to the fact that this\n\nhealing was connected with the whole position of the constellations, and\n\nthat at the time in question, the constellations throughout the heavens\n\nstood in such a way as could only have happened when the sun had set.\n\nThe meaning of that, at the time, the requisite healing forces could make\n\nthemselves felt after sun-set, and the Christ Jesus is represented as the\n\nintermediary Who brought the sick into connection with the forces of the\n\ncosmos which, just at that time could work curatively. These forces were\n\nthe same as those which worked as Christ in Jesus. It was through the\n\npresence of Christ that the healing took place, because in consequence\n\nof the same, the sick person was exposed to the healing forces of the\n\nCosmos which could only work as they did when they were in the right\n\nrelationship to time and space. Thus these forces worked on the sick\n\nperson through their representative the Christ. But it was only just\n\nduring the time of Christ on earth that they could so work. It was only\n\nthen that such a connection existed between the cosmic constellations and\n\nthe powers of the human organism, that for certain illnesses, healing\n\ncould intervene when through the instrumentality of the Christ Jesus, the\n\ncosmic grouping of the same forces was able to work on men. A repetition\n\nof this relationship in the evolution of the cosmos and the earth is\n\nas little possible as is a second incarnation of the Christ in a human\n\nbody. Regarded in this way, the life of the Christ Jesus appears as the\n\nearthly expression of a definite connection between the cosmos and the\n\nforces of man. The tarrying of a sick person by the side of Christ means\n\nthat through the proximity of Christ, this sick person found himself in\n\nsuch a relation with the macrocosm that the latter could work upon him\n\ncuratively.\n\n\n\nTherewith the points of view have been specified which enable us to\n\ndiscern how the guidance of humanity has come under the influence of\n\nthe Christ. The other forces, however, which had remained behind in the\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic times worked further side by side with those that are\n\npermeated by the Christ. This is evident even in the attitude frequently\n\nadopted to-day towards the Gospels. Literary works appear in which great\n\npains are taken to show that the Gospels can be understood through an\n\nastrological interpretation. The greatest opponents of the Gospels\n\nemploy this astrological interpretation in such a manner that, the way,\n\nfor example, taken by the Archangel Gabriel from Elizabeth to Mary is\n\nsupposed to signify nothing more than the progress of the sun from the\n\nconstellation of Virgo to another. This, in a certain sense, is correct,\n\nexcept that these thoughts were poured in this manner into our age by the\n\nbeings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic Period. Under\n\nsuch an influence people are induced to a make-belief that the Gospels\n\npresent only allegories in the place of definite cosmic relations. The\n\ntruth really is, that in the Christ the whole cosmos finds expression\n\nand therefore one can express the life of the Christ by connecting its\n\nseparate events with the cosmic relations which work into Earth existence\n\nunceasingly through the Christ. A right understanding of this matter\n\nwill thus lead to a full recognition of the Christ, as having lived on\n\nearth, whereas the above mentioned error, if it were true, would mean\n\nthat the Christ life in the Gospels is expressed by cosmic constellation\n\nand shows that it was only a matter of constellations being treated\n\nallegorically, and that there was no real earthly Christ at all.\n\n\n\nIf a comparison were to be used, we might think of each human being as\n\nrepresented by a spherical mirror which, if it were set up, would give\n\npictures of all its surroundings. Let us suppose we were to trace with a\n\npencil the outline of all that is shown from the surroundings. We could\n\nthen take the mirror and carry the picture about with us wherever we\n\nwent. Let this be a symbol for the fact that when a person is born, he\n\nbrings with him a copy of the cosmos in himself, and afterwards carries\n\nabout with him all through his life the effect of this one picture. The\n\nmirror might, however, be left untouched by the pencil, so that wherever\n\nthe person carried it, it would depict the immediate surroundings. It\n\nthen would always be giving a picture of the collective environment. This\n\nwould be a symbol of the Christ from the baptism by St. John up to the\n\nmystery of Golgotha. That which, in the case of any other person, passes\n\ninto his earthly existence at birth only flowed into the Christ-Jesus\n\nat every moment. And when the mystery of Golgotha was consummated,\n\nthat which had been radiating from out the cosmos passed over into the\n\nspiritual substance of the earth, and has from that time forward been\n\nunited with the spirit of the earth.\n\n\n\nWhen St. Paul became clairvoyant before Damascus, he could recognize\n\nthat That which had formerly been in the cosmos has passed over into the\n\nspirit of the earth. Of this every one can be convinced who can bring his\n\nsoul into such a condition that he can have the same experience as had\n\nSt. Paul. It is in the twentieth century that those people will first\n\nappear who will have St. Paul’s experience of the Christ event in a\n\nspiritual way.\n\n\n\nWhereas up to our times this event would be experienced only by such\n\npersons as had gained clairvoyant powers by means of an esoteric\n\ntraining, hereafter to look upon the Christ in the spiritual sphere\n\nsurrounding the earth will be possible for the advanced powers of the\n\nsoul in the course of the natural evolution of humanity. This as a\n\nrepeated experience of the event before Damascus will be possible for\n\nsome people from a certain point of time in the twentieth century. The\n\nnumber of such people will afterwards increase, until in the distant\n\nfuture, it will be a natural faculty of the human soul.\n\n\n\nWith the entrance of Christ into the evolution of the earth an entirely\n\nnew impulse or direction was given to evolution. External facts of\n\nhistory also express this. In the early times of post-Atlantean evolution\n\nmen knew very well that above them there was not merely a physical Mars,\n\nbut that what they saw as Mars, Jupiter or Saturn was the expression\n\nfor a spiritual being. In later times this perception was completely\n\nforgotten. The heavenly bodies became, according to human ideas, mere\n\nbodies to be estimated according to their physical condition. And in\n\nthe Middle Ages people saw in connection with the stars only what the\n\neyes can see the sphere of Venus, the sphere of the Sun, the sphere\n\nof Mars, etc., up to the sphere of the fixed stars; and then came the\n\neighth sphere like a solid blue wall behind. Then Copernicus appeared\n\nand broke down the idea that only that which is perceptible to the senses\n\ncan be authoritative. The modern physical scientists may indeed say:\n\n“It is madness to declare that the world is Maya, or illusion, and that\n\nyou must look into a spiritual world in order to see the truth, for in\n\nspite of all you say true science is that which relies on the senses and\n\nnotifies what these senses tell.” But when did astronomers rely only on\n\nthe senses? Surely at the very time when that astronomical science was\n\ndominant which is attacked by the science of to-day! It was at that time\n\nwhen Copernicus began to think out what exists in the cosmic space beyond\n\nthe evidence of the senses, that our modern astronomy as a science began.\n\nAnd so it is in every domain of science. Everywhere that science, in the\n\nmost modern sense of the word, has arisen, it has done so in opposition\n\nto what had been apparent to the senses. When Copernicus declared “what\n\nyou see is Maya or deception, rely on what you cannot see,” then the\n\nscience came into being which is recognized as such to-day. It might thus\n\nbe said to the representative of modern science “your science itself only\n\nbecame ‘science’ when it was no longer willing to depend upon the senses\n\nonly.”\n\n\n\nGiordano Bruno came as philosophical interpreter of the teachings of\n\nCopernicus. He led the gaze of man out into cosmic space, and announced\n\nthat what people had called the limitations of space, what they had\n\nplaced there as the eighth sphere limiting everything in space was\n\nin reality no limitation; it was Maya, or illusion; for an infinite\n\nnumber of worlds had been poured forth into cosmic space. That which was\n\nformerly considered to be the boundary of space was shown to be only the\n\nboundary of the sense-world of man, and if we direct our gaze beyond\n\nthe sense-world, we shall no longer see the world only as known to the\n\nsenses, but we shall also recognize Infinity.\n\n\n\nFrom this it is apparent how the course of human evolution has been\n\nsuch that man started from an originally spiritual view of the cosmos\n\nand in the course of time lost it. In its place there came a mere\n\nsense-perception of the world. Then there came into evolution the Christ\n\nImpulse. Through this, mankind was led to stamp the spiritual view once\n\nmore upon the materialistic. At that moment when Giordano Bruno burst the\n\nfetters of the sense illusion, the Christ evolution was so far advanced,\n\nthat the soul power, which had been kindled by the Christ Impulse, could\n\nthen be active within him. Therewith an indication is given of the whole\n\nsignificance of how the life of Christ penetrates all human evolution, an\n\nevolution only at the beginning of which humanity stands to-day.\n\n\n\nTo what then does spiritual science now aspire? It completes the work\n\nbegun for external science by Giordano Bruno and others in that it says:\n\nthat which external science is able to perceive is Maya, or illusion.\n\nJust as formerly one looked to the “eighth sphere” and thought that space\n\nwas thereby bounded, so contemporary human thought believes that man is\n\nshut in or enclosed between birth and death. Spiritual science, however,\n\nexpands man’s vision by directing his attention out and beyond the limits\n\nof birth and death.\n\n\n\nThere is a continuous chain in human evolution which such ideas as\n\nthese make us recognize. And in the true sense of the words, that\n\nwhich resulted in the conquest of sense illusion through Copernicus\n\nand Giordano Bruno, already proceeded from the inspiration due to\n\nthat spiritual current which is now working in the modern spiritual\n\nscience of theosophy. What one might call the newer esotericism worked\n\nin a mysterious manner on Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler and others. Those\n\ntherefore who now stand, base their thought on foundations laid by\n\nGiordano Bruno and Copernicus and do not wish to accept theosophy, are\n\nunfaithful to their own traditions in desiring to hold fast by sense\n\nillusion. But spiritual science demonstrates that, as Giordano Bruno\n\nforced a way through the blue firmament of heaven, even so does this\n\nscience break down the barriers of birth and death for man by showing how\n\nhe originates from out of the macrocosm, lives in a physical existence,\n\npasses through death, and re-enters macrocosmic life. And what we see\n\nin a limited degree in each individual meets us unrestrictedly and in a\n\nlarger sense in the representative of the spirit of the cosmos in the\n\nChrist-Jesus. Once and once only could that impulse be given which the\n\nChrist gave. Once only could the whole cosmos be thus reflected, for the\n\nconjunction of the stars which then took place can never be repeated.\n\nIn order to give an impulse to the earth, this conjunction was obliged\n\nto work through a human body. As it is true that this same grouping\n\ncannot occur a second time, so it is equally true that the Christ was\n\nonly once incarnated. Only if one did not know that the Christ is the\n\nrepresentative of the whole universe and only if it were impossible to\n\nwin one’s way to this Christ-Idea, the elements for which are given\n\nthrough spiritual science only then would it be possible to maintain\n\nthat Christ could appear more than once upon the earth.\n\n\n\nThus we see how an idea of Christ arises out of the new spiritual science\n\nor theosophy, which reveals to man in a new form his connection with the\n\nwhole macrocosm. Certainly, in order to gain a true knowledge of the\n\nChrist, those inspiring forces are absolutely necessary which are now\n\nbeing bestowed by those same superhuman beings who formerly guided the\n\nEgypto-Chaldæic epoch and who have now put themselves under the Christ.\n\nThere is need of a new inspiration of this kind, of an inspiration which\n\nthe great esoteric teachers of the middle ages had prepared from the\n\nthirteenth century onwards, and which from this time forth must ever come\n\nmore and more into publicity. When man, according to the meaning of this\n\nscience, prepares his soul aright for the knowledge of the spirit-world,\n\nhe can then hear clairaudiently and he can see clairvoyantly what is\n\nrevealed by the old Chaldæic and Egyptian angel beings who are now again\n\nacting as spiritual leaders under the guidance of the Christ. That\n\nwhich humanity will some time later actually gain thereby could only be\n\nprepared in the first centuries of Christianity and up to our times.\n\n\n\nConsequently we may say that in the future there will live in the\n\nhearts of men an idea of the Christ incomparable in greatness with\n\nanything which humanity has so far recognized. That which arose as a\n\nfirst impulse through the Christ, and has lived as an idea of Him up to\n\nthe present time even in the case of the best representatives of the\n\nChrist-principle is only a preparation for the true understanding of the\n\nChrist. It would be strange indeed if, against those who in the West gave\n\nexpression in such a way as this to the Christ-idea, it were brought as\n\na reproach that they do not stand on the foundation of western Christian\n\ntradition, but it is quite possible, for this western tradition does not\n\nby any means suffice to help us to comprehend the Christ of the near\n\nfuture.\n\n\n\nFrom the hypothesis of eastern esotericism we can see the spiritual\n\ndirection of humanity gradually flowing into what may be in a real, true\n\nsense called the guidance, which comes from the Christ-impulse. That\n\nwhich is appearing as the new esotericism will flow slowly into the\n\nhearts of men, and the spiritual guidance of men and of humanity will\n\never more and more be consciously seen in such a light. We realize to\n\nourselves how at first the Christ-principle flowed into the hearts of\n\nmen because the Christ had gone about Palestine in the physical body of\n\nJesus of Nazareth. Later men gradually surrendered themselves entirely\n\nto a reliance on the world of sense, and could only receive the impulse\n\nwhich corresponded to their perception. Afterwards that same impulse so\n\nworked through the inspiration of the new esotericism that such spirits\n\nas Nicholas Cusamus, Copernicus and Galileo were able to be inspired\n\nand Copernicus, for instance, was enabled to make this assertion: “That\n\nwhich is evident to the senses cannot teach the truth about the solar\n\nsystem; if we want to find the truth we must investigate behind sense\n\nappearances.” At that time men, even spirits like Giordano Bruno, were\n\nnot yet ripe enough to join consciously to the new esoteric stream. The\n\nspirit of the movement had to work in them unconsciously. Yet powerful\n\nand magnificent was the announcement of Giordano Bruno: “When a human\n\nbeing enters into existence by means of birth, then it is something\n\nmacrocosmic that concentrates itself as a monad; and when a human being\n\npasses through death the monad spreads itself out again; that which was\n\nenclosed within the body spreads itself out in the cosmos in order to\n\ndraw itself together again in other stages of existence, and again to\n\nspread itself out.” There Bruno gave expression to mighty conceptions\n\nwhich, even if expressed in stammering tongue, were yet in entire accord\n\nwith the sense of the new esotericism.\n\n\n\nThe spiritual influences which lead humanity need not work in such a way\n\nthat man is always conscious of them. For example, they put Galileo in\n\nthe cathedral of Pisa. Thousands had seen the old church lamp there, but\n\nthey have not seen it as did Galileo. He saw the church lamp swinging;\n\ncompared the time of its oscillation with the beat of his own pulse;\n\nfound that the church lamp swung in a regular rhythm resembling his\n\npulse-beat; and from this discovered the laws of the pendulum in the\n\nsense of modern physics. Anyone acquainted with contemporary physics\n\nknows that these would not be possible without Galileo’s principle. In\n\nthis way the force was then working which is now appearing as spiritual\n\nscience; Galileo was placed in the cathedral of Pisa before the\n\noscillating church lamp, and modern physics gained its principles. In\n\nsuch a mysterious way do the guiding spiritual forces of humanity perform\n\ntheir work.\n\n\n\nWe are now approaching the time when people are to become conscious\n\nof these guiding powers. We shall always come to a better and better\n\nunderstanding of what has to happen in the future if we rightly\n\nunderstand what is working inspirationally as the new esotericism, and\n\nwhich shows that the same spiritual beings, indicated by the ancient\n\nEgyptians when the Greeks asked them about their teachers, who then ruled\n\nas gods, are now again assuming control, through having placed themselves\n\nunder the leadership of the Christ. Ever more and more will men feel how\n\nthey can cause to reappear in a brighter lustre, in a nobler style and on\n\na higher level, that which was pre-Christian. The consciousness necessary\n\nfor the present time, which must be an intensified consciousness, ought\n\nto give us a feeling of our high duty and great responsibility in\n\nreference to the recognition of the spiritual world, and this can only\n\npenetrate into our soul when we have recognized in the sense indicated,\n\nwhat is the task of spiritual science.\n\n\n\n[2] By “Ancient Persian” is not meant “Persian” in the usual historic\n\nsense, but a pre-historic Asiatic (Iranian) civilization which developed\n\nin that land over which, later on, the Persian Kingdom extended.\n\n\n\n= THE END.\n",

What is here set forth was therefore spoken to an audience acquainted with occult science, or theosophy. A similar acquaintance is assumed in this work. It is throughout based on the foundations given in my books, “Theosophy” and “An Outline of Occult Science.” To anyone taking up the present work who is unacquainted with these premises, it must needs appear the strange outpouring of mere fancy, but the above-named books point out the scientific basis of everything stated in this one.\n\nI have completely re-written the shorthand report of the lectures; nevertheless it has been my intention on publishing them, to preserve the character given in oral delivery. This is specially mentioned because it is in general my opinion that the form of work intended for reading should be quite different from that used in speaking. I have expressed this principle of mine in all my earlier writings, as far as they were intended for the press. If in this instance I have worked out my subject in closer connection with the spoken word, it is because I have reasons for letting the work appear at this juncture, and an adaptation completely in accordance with the above rule would take a great deal of time.\nRUDOLF STEINER.\nMunich, August 20, 1911.",

Steiner emphasizes that the content is primarily aimed at an audience already familiar with the concepts of occult science, or theosophy, and builds upon the foundational ideas presented in his earlier works, \"Theosophy\" and \"An Outline of Occult Science.\" He acknowledges that without an understanding of these foundational concepts, the material in the current work might seem like a mere flight of fancy to the uninitiated reader. However, he assures that his previous books provide a scientific grounding for the statements made in this one.\n\nSteiner also notes that he has thoroughly revised the shorthand report of the lectures for publication, striving to maintain the oral delivery's character. This decision is highlighted as a departure from his usual practice, where he advocates for a distinct difference between written and spoken forms of work. He mentions that his earlier writings, intended for print, adhered to this principle. The reason for maintaining a closer connection to the spoken word in this instance, he explains, is driven by the timely need to publish the work, suggesting that a full adaptation to his usual written style would require more time than available. This preface, signed in Munich on August 20, 1911, sets the stage for the reader to engage with the lectures' content, provided they have a background in theosophy or are willing to explore Steiner's foundational works for a deeper understanding.",

Firstly, he acknowledges that the form of work intended for reading should generally be quite different from that used in speaking, a principle he has adhered to in his earlier writings intended for the press. He states, \"it is in general my opinion that the form of work intended for reading should be quite different from that used in speaking.\" This indicates that he is aware of the conventional distinction between written and oral forms of communication and usually prefers to adapt his spoken content for a reading audience.\n\nHowever, in this instance, Steiner chooses to deviate from his usual practice due to specific reasons that compel him to publish the work sooner rather than later. He mentions, \"If in this instance I have worked out my subject in closer connection with the spoken word, it is because I have reasons for letting the work appear at this juncture.\" This suggests that there is an urgency or a particular importance attached to the timing of the publication, which outweighs his usual preference for adapting spoken content for a reading format.\n\nMoreover, Steiner implies that a thorough adaptation of the lectures from their oral form to a form more suitable for reading would require a significant amount of time, a luxury he implies he cannot afford in this situation. He states, \"an adaptation completely in accordance with the above rule would take a great deal of time.\" This further underscores the urgency or specific considerations at play, leading him to prioritize timely publication over the extensive process of adaptation.\n\nIn summary, Steiner's decision to publish the lectures in a form closely connected to the spoken word reflects his urgency or specific reasons for letting the work appear at this particular juncture by indicating a prioritization of timely dissemination over his usual practice of adapting spoken content for a reading audience, driven by the need to publish without the delay that a thorough adaptation would entail.",

He explains, \"If in this instance I have worked out my subject in closer connection with the spoken word, it is because I have reasons for letting the work appear at this juncture, and an adaptation completely in accordance with the above rule would take a great deal of time.\" Despite his general opinion, Steiner chose to preserve the oral delivery's character in the written form of the present work.

This context suggests that the oral delivery style might help maintain the intended audience's engagement, as it preserves the directness and immediacy characteristic of spoken communication. The preservation of the oral character could therefore facilitate a deeper connection with readers already familiar with the subject matter, as it mirrors the experience of the original audience.\n\nHowever, Steiner also notes, \"it is in general my opinion that the form of work intended for reading should be quite different from that used in speaking.\" This acknowledgment implies that adhering to the oral delivery style in written form might present challenges for readers unaccustomed to this approach. Specifically, the narrative flow, rhetorical devices, and structural elements typical of oral presentations might differ significantly from those expected in written texts, potentially affecting clarity and accessibility for some readers.\n\nMoreover, Steiner's decision is framed as a compromise made for timely publication: \"an adaptation completely in accordance with the above rule would take a great deal of time.\" This suggests that the preservation of the oral character was also a practical decision, allowing the material to be published without the extensive revisions that a more conventional written adaptation would require. As a result, readers might encounter a text that feels more immediate and less polished than Steiner's other works intended for the press, which could influence their interpretation by presenting the ideas in a rawer, perhaps more authentic, form.\n\nIn summary, Steiner's adherence to the character of oral delivery in the written publication of his lectures might enhance engagement and authenticity for readers familiar with theosophy, while potentially posing challenges in terms of clarity and accessibility for those less accustomed to such a style. This approach reflects a balance between maintaining the immediacy of the original lectures and the practical considerations of publication.",

He emphasizes his belief that written works should differ from spoken ones, a principle he has expressed in his previous writings.

            "text": "A man reflecting on his own nature soon becomes conscious that there is within him a second and more powerful self than the one bounded by his thoughts, his feelings and the fully-conscious impulses of his will. He becomes aware that he is subject to that second self, as to a higher power. It is true that at first he will feel it to be a lower entity as compared with the one limited by his intelligent and fully-conscious soul, with its inclinations towards the Good and True. And at first he will strive to overcome that lower entity.\n\nBut closer self-examination may reveal something else about the second self. If we often, in the course of our lives, make a kind of survey of our acts and experiences, we make a singular discovery about ourselves. And the older we are, the more significant do we think that discovery. If we ask ourselves what we did or said at a particular period of our lives, it turns out that we have done very many things which are only really understood in later years. Seven or eight, or perhaps twenty years ago, we did certain things, and we know quite well that only now, long afterwards, is our intelligence ripe enough to understand what we did or said at that earlier period.\n\nMany people do not make such discoveries about themselves, because they do not lay themselves out to do so. But it is extremely profitable to hold such communion frequently with one’s own soul. For directly a man becomes aware that he has done things in former years which he is only now beginning to understand, that formerly his intelligence was not ripe enough to understand them, at a moment such as this, something like the following feeling arises in the soul: The man feels himself protected by a good power, which rules in the depths of his own being; he begins to have more and more confidence in the fact that really, in the highest sense of the word, he is not alone in the world, and that everything which he understands, and is consciously able to do, is after all but a small part of what he really accomplished in the world.\n\nIf this observation is often made, it is possible to carry out in practical life something which is very easy to see theoretically. It is easy to see that we should not make much progress in life if we had to accomplish everything we have to do, in full consciousness, with our intelligence taking note of every circumstance affecting us. In order to see this theoretically, we have only to reflect as follows: In what section of his life does a human being perform those acts which are really most important as regards his own existence? When does he act most wisely for himself? He does this from about the time of his birth up to that period to which his memory goes back when in later life he surveys his earthly existence. If he recalls what he did three, four or five years ago, and then goes farther and farther back, he comes at last to a certain point in childhood, beyond which memory cannot go. What lies beyond it may be told by parents or others, but a man’s own recollection only extends to a certain point in the past. That point is the moment at which the individual felt himself to be an ego. In the lives of people whose memory is limited to the normal, there must always be such a point, but previously to it, the human soul has worked in the wisest possible manner on the individual, and never afterwards, when man has gained consciousness, can he accomplish such vast and magnificent work on himself as he carries out, from subconscious motives, during the first years of childhood.\n\nFor we know that at birth man takes into the physical world what he has brought with him as the result of his former earthly lives. When he is born, his physical brain, for instance, is but a very imperfect instrument. The soul has to work a finer organization into that instrument, in order to make it the agent of everything which the soul is capable of performing. In point of fact the human soul, before it is fully conscious, works upon the brain so as to make it an instrument for exercising all the abilities, aptitudes, qualities, etc., which appertain to the soul as the result of its former earthly lives. This work on a man’s own body is directed from points of view which are wiser than anything which he can subsequently do for himself when in possession of full consciousness.\n\nMoreover, man during this period not only elaborates his brain plastically, but has to learn three most important things for his earthly existence. The first is the equilibrium of his own body in space. The man of the present day entirely overlooks the meaning of this statement, which touches upon one of the most essential differences between man and animals. An animal is destined from the outset to develop its equilibrium in space in a certain way; one animal is destined to be a climber, another a swimmer, etc. An animal is so organized from the beginning as to be able to bear itself rightly in space, and this is the case with all animals up to and including the mammals most resembling man. If zoologists would ponder this fact, they would lay less emphasis on the number of similar bones and muscles in man and animals, etc., for this is of much less account than the fact that man is not endowed at the outset with the complete equipment for his conditions of equilibrium. He has first to form them out of the sum total of his being. It is significant that man should have to work upon himself, in order to make, out of a being that cannot walk at all, one that can walk erect. It is man himself who gives himself his vertical position, or his equilibrium in space. He brings himself into relation with the force of gravitation. It will obviously be easy for anyone taking a superficial view of the matter to question this statement, with apparently good reason. It may be said that man is just as much organized for his erect walk as, for instance, a climbing animal for climbing. But more accurate observation will show that it is the peculiarity of the animal’s organization that causes its position in space. In man it is the soul which brings itself into relation with space and controls the organization.\n\nThe second thing which man teaches himself, and that by means of the entity which proceeds from one incarnation to another as the same being, is speech. Through speech he comes into relation with his fellow-men. This relation makes him the vehicle of that spiritual life which interpenetrates the world primarily through man. Emphasis has often been laid, with good reason, on the fact that a human being removed, before he could speak, to a desert island, and kept apart from his fellows, would not learn to talk. On the other hand, what we receive by inheritance, what is implanted in us for use in later years and is subject to the principles of heredity, does not depend on a man’s dwelling with his fellows. For instance, his inherited conditions oblige him to change his teeth in his seventh year. If it were possible for him to grow up on a desert island, he would still change them then. But he only learns to talk, when his soul’s inner being, i.e., that which is carried on from one life to another, is stimulated. The germ, however, for the development of the larynx must be formed during the period at which man has not yet acquired his ego-consciousness. Before the time to which his memory goes back, he must plant the germ for developing his larynx, in order that this may become the organ of speech.\n\nAnd then there is a third thing: It is not so well known that man learns this of himself, from that part of his inner being which he carries on from one incarnation to another. It is the life within the world of thought itself. The elaboration of the brain is undertaken because the brain is the instrument of thought. At the beginning of life, this organ is still plastic, because the individual has to form it for himself as an instrument of thought, in accordance with the intention of the entity which is carried on from one life to another. The brain immediately after birth is, as it was bound to be, in accordance with the forces inherited from parents and other ancestors. But the individual has to express in his thought what he is as an individual being, in accordance with his former earthly lives. Therefore he must re-model the inherited peculiarities of his brain, after birth, when he has become physically independent of his parents and other ancestors.\n\nWe thus see that man accomplishes momentous things during the first years of his life. He is working on himself in the spirit of the highest wisdom. In point of fact, if it were a question of his own cleverness, it is possible that he might not accomplish what he does without that cleverness during the first period of his life. Why is all this accomplished in those depths of the soul which lie outside consciousness? This happens because the human soul and entire being are, during the first years of earthly life, in much closer connection with the spiritual worlds of the higher hierarchies than is afterwards the case. A clairvoyant who has gone through sufficient spiritual development to be able to witness actual spiritual events, sees something exceedingly significant at the moment when the ego acquires consciousness, i.e., the earliest point to which the memory of later years goes back. Whereas what we call the child’s aura floats round it in its earliest years like a wonderful human and superhuman power, and, being really the higher part of the child, is everywhere continued on into the spiritual world, at the moment to which memory goes back, this aura sinks more into the inner being of the child. A human being is able to feel himself a continuous ego as far back as that point of time, because then that which was previously in close connection with the higher worlds, passed into his ego. Henceforward the consciousness is at every point brought into connection with the external world. This is not the case with a very young child, to whom things appear only as a surrounding world of dreams.\nMan works on himself by means of a wisdom which is not within him. That wisdom is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom of later years. The higher wisdom becomes obscured in the human soul, which in exchange receives consciousness.\n\nThe higher wisdom works from out of the spiritual world deep into the bodily part of man, so that man is able by its means to form his brain out of spirit. It is rightly said that even the wisest may learn from a child, for in the child is working the wisdom which does not pass later into consciousness. Through that wisdom man has something like telephonic connection with the spiritual beings in whose world he lives between death and re-birth. From that world there is something still streaming into the aura of a child, which is, as an individual being, immediately under the guidance of the entire spiritual world to which it belongs. Spiritual forces from that world continue to flow into a child. They cease so to flow at the point of time to which memory goes back. It is these forces which enable a child to bring itself into a definite relation to gravitation. They form the larynx, and so mould the brain that it becomes a living instrument for the expression of thought, feeling and will.\n\nWhat is present in childhood to a supreme degree, so that the individual is then working out of a self which is still in direct connection with higher worlds, continues to some extent even in later years, although the conditions change in the manner indicated above. If at a later stage of life we feel that we did something years before which we are only now able to understand, it is just because we previously let ourselves be guided by higher wisdom, and only after the lapse of years have we attained to an understanding of the reasons of our conduct.\nFrom all this we can feel that, immediately after birth, we had not escaped so very far from the world in which we were before entering upon physical existence, and that we can never really escape from it wholly. Our share in higher spirituality enters our physical life and accompanies us throughout it. We often feel that what is within us is not only a higher self which is gradually being evolved, but is something higher which is there already, and is the motive cause of our so often developing beyond ourselves.\n\nAll ideals and artistic creations which man is able to produce, as well as all the natural healing forces in his own body, by means of which he is continually able to adjust the injuries that befall him in life, all these powers do not proceed from ordinary intellect, but from those deeper forces which in our earliest years are at work on our equilibrium in space, on the formation of our larynx and on the brain. For these same forces are still at work in man in later years. When sickness attacks us, it is often said that external forces cannot help us, but that our organism must develop the healing powers latent within it: by this is meant that there is a profoundly wise activity present in humanity. Moreover, it is from the same source that proceed these best forces whereby knowledge of the spiritual world is attained, i.e., true clairvoyance.\n\nThe question now suggests itself, why do the higher forces which have been described work upon human nature only during early childhood? One-half of the answer may be easily given as follows: If those higher forces went on working in the same way, man would be always a child. He would not attain the full ego-consciousness. From within his own being must proceed the motive power which previously worked on him from without. But there is a more important reason, which explains still more about the mysteries of human life than what has just been said, and that is the following:\n\nIt is possible to learn through occult science, that the human body, as it exists at its present stage of evolution, must be regarded as having arrived at its present form under different circumstances. It is known to the occultist that this evolution was effected by means of the working of various forces on the sum-total of man’s being; certain forces worked on the physical body, others on the etheric, others on the astral body. Human nature has arrived at its present form through the action of those beings whom we call the Luciferic and Ahrimanic. By their means it has, in a certain way, become worse than it need have been if those forces only had been active within it which proceed from the spiritual rulers of the cosmos who desire to evolve man along straight lines. The causes of sorrow, disease and even of death are to be sought in the fact that, besides the beings who are evolving man in a straight line forwards, there are also ruling the Luciferic and Ahrimanic spirits, who are continually crossing the line of straightforward, progressive development.\n\nThere is something in what man brings into existence at birth, which is better than what he can make out of it in later life. This is so, because the Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces have but little influence over man during early childhood; they are virtually only operative in what man makes out of himself by his conscious life. If he were to retain in full force beyond early childhood that part of his being which is better than the rest, he would be unable to endure its influence, because his whole being is weakened by the opposite forces of Lucifer and Ahriman. Man’s organism in the physical world is so constituted that it is only when he is, so to speak, as soft and pliable as a child, that he can endure within him those direct forces of the spiritual world which operate within him during early childhood. He would be shattered, if during his later life there were still directly working in him those forces which underlie the faculty of equilibrium in space, and the formation of the larynx and the brain. Those forces are so tremendous that, if they were to go on working, our organism would pine away under the influence of their holiness. Man must only have recourse to such forces for the purpose of that kind of activity which brings him into conscious connection with the supersensible world.\n\nBut out of this there arises a thought which is of great significance, if rightly understood. It is expressed in the New Testament in the words “Except ye become as little children, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.” What then becomes manifest as man’s highest ideal, if what has just been said be rightly received? Surely this, the drawing ever nearer and nearer to what we may call a conscious relation to the forces which work in man unknown to him during early childhood. Only it must be borne in mind that man would collapse under the power of those forces, if they were at once to operate in his conscious life. For this reason, careful preparation is necessary for the attainment of those faculties which induce the perception of supersensible worlds. The object of such preparation is to qualify man to bear what he is unable to bear in ordinary life.\n\nNow the passing of the individual through successive incarnations is of importance for the collective evolution of the human race. The latter has advanced through successive lives in the past, and is still advancing, and parallel with it the earth too is moving forwards in its evolution. The time will come when the earth will have reached the end of its career. Then the earthly planet will fall away as a physical entity from the sum-total of human souls, just as the human body falls away from the spirit at death, when, in order to continue living, the soul enters the spiritual realm which is adapted for it between death and re-birth. When once this is realized, it must appear as man’s highest ideal to have progressed far enough at earthly death, to be able to reap all possible benefits which may be obtained from earthly life.\n\nNow those forces which prevent man from being able to endure the forces working upon him during early childhood come out of the substance of the earth. When this has fallen away from a human being, the latter, if he has attained the aim of his life, must have advanced far enough to be able actually to give himself up, with his whole being, to the powers which at present are only active in man during childhood. Thus the object of evolution through successive earthly lives is gradually to make the whole individual, including therefore the conscious part, into an expression of the powers which are ruling in him under the influence of the spiritual world, though he does not know it, during the first years of his life. The thought which takes possession of the soul after such reflections as these, must fill it with humility, but also with a due consciousness of the dignity of man. The thought is this: man is not alone; there is something living within him which is constantly affording him proof that he can rise above himself to something which is already growing beyond him, and which will go on growing from one life to another. This thought can assume more and more definite form; and in that case it affords something supremely soothing and elevating, at the same time filling the soul with corresponding humility and modesty. What is it that man has within him in this way? Surely a higher, divine human being, by whom he is able to feel himself interpenetrated, saying to himself, “He is my guide within me.”\n\nFrom such a point of view, it is not long before we arrive at the thought that by all the means in our power we should strive to be in harmony with that within our being which is wiser than conscious intelligence. And we shall be referred on from the directly conscious self to an enlarged self, in the presence of which all false pride and presumption will be extinguished and subdued. This feeling develops into another, which opens the way to accurate understanding of the nature of present human imperfection; and the consciousness of this leads to the knowledge that man may become perfect, if once the larger spirituality ruling within him is allowed to bear the same relation to his consciousness which it bore to the unconscious life of the soul in early childhood.\n\nIf it often happens that memory does not go back as far as the fourth year of a child’s life, it may nevertheless be said that the influence of the higher spirit-sphere, in the above sense, lasts through the first three years. At the end of that span of time a child becomes capable of linking its impressions of the outer world to the ideas of its ego. It is true that this coherent ego-conception can only be reckoned as existing as far back as memory extends. Yet we must say that virtually memory extends to the beginning of the fourth year, only it is so weak at the beginning of distinct ego-consciousness as to be imperceptible. It may therefore be granted that those higher powers which dispose of a human being in the early years of childhood can be operative for three years; therefore man, during the present middle period of the earth, is so organized that he can receive these forces for only three years.\n\nSupposing a man now stood before us, and that some cosmic powers could cause his ordinary ego to be removed. (For this purpose we must assume that it would be possible to remove from the physical, etheric and astral bodies the ordinary ego which has gone through the incarnations with the man.) And now suppose that an ego could then be introduced into the three bodies which is working in connection with spiritual worlds, what would happen to a person thus treated? At the end of three years his body would necessarily be shattered. Something would occur, through cosmic karma, which would prevent the spirit-being which would be in connection with higher worlds, from living more than three years in that body.[1] Only at the end of all his earthly lives will man have that within him which will enable him to live more than three years with that spirit-being. But then, it is true, man will be able to say to himself, “Not I, but that Higher One within me, Who was always there, is now working in me.” Till that time comes, he is not able to say this. The most he can say is that he feels that higher being, but has not yet progressed far enough with his real, actual human ego, to be able to bring the other to full life within him.\n\nSupposing then that, at some time in the middle earth-period, a human organism were to come into the world, and later in life be freed from his ego by the action of certain cosmic powers, receiving in exchange the ego which usually only works in man during the first three years of life, and which would be in connection with the spiritual worlds in which man exists between death and re-birth: how long would such a person be able to live in an earthly body? About three years. For at the end of that time, something would arise through cosmic karma, which would destroy the human organism in question.\n\nWhat is here supposed is, however, a historical fact. The human organism which stood in the river Jordan at John’s baptism when the ego of Jesus of Nazareth left the three bodies, contained, after the baptism, in complete conscious development, that higher Self of humanity which usually works with cosmic wisdom on a child without its knowledge. At the same time, the necessity arose that this Self which was in connection with the higher spirit-world could only live for three years in the appropriate human organism. Events had then to take place which brought the earthly life of that being to a close. The outer events in the life of Christ Jesus are to be interpreted as absolutely conditioned by the inner causes just set forth, and present themselves as the outward expression of those causes.\nWe are now able to see the deeper connection existing between that which is man’s guide in life, which streams in upon our childhood like the dawn and is always working below the surface of our consciousness as the best part of us, and that which once upon a time entered the whole of human evolution and was able to dwell for three years in a human frame.\n\nWhat then is manifested in that “higher” ego, which is in connection with the spiritual hierarchies, and which in due time entered the body of Jesus of Nazareth? This entrance being symbolically represented by the sign of the Spirit descending in the form of a dove, and by the words, “This is my well-beloved Son, to-day have I begotten him” (for so stood the words originally). If we fix our eyes upon this picture, we are contemplating the highest human ideal. For it means nothing else than that the history of Jesus of Nazareth is a statement of this fact: “The Christ can be discerned in every human being.” And even if there were no Gospels and no tradition, to tell us that once a Christ lived on earth, we should yet learn through knowledge of human nature that the Christ is living in man.\n\nThe recognition of the forces working in human nature during childhood is the recognition of the Christ in man. The question now arises, does this recognition lead to the further perception of the fact that this Christ once really dwelt on earth in a human body? Without bringing forward any documents, this question may be answered in the affirmative. For genuine clairvoyant knowledge of self leads the man of the present day to see that powers are to be discovered in the human soul which emanate from the Christ. These powers are at work during the first three years of childhood without any action being taken by the human being. In later life they may be called into action, if the Christ be sought within the soul by inner meditation. Man was not always able, as he is now, to find the Christ within himself. There were times when no inner meditation could lead him to the Christ. This again we learn from clairvoyant perception. In the interval between that past time when man could not find the Christ in himself, and the present time when he can find him, there took place Christ’s earthly life. And that life itself is the cause of man’s being able to find the Christ in himself in the manner that has been pointed out. Thus to clairvoyant perception the earthly life of Christ is proved without any historical records.\n\nIt is just as if the Christ had said, “I will be such an ideal for you human beings as, raised to a spiritual level, will show you that which is fulfilled in each human body.” In his early childhood man learns from the spirit how to walk physically, i.e., he is shown by the spirit his way through earthly life. From the spirit he learns to speak, i.e., to form truth; or in other words, he develops the essence of truth out of sound during the first three years of his life. And the life too, which man lives on earth as an ego-being, obtains its vital organ through what is formed in the first three years of childhood. Thus man learns to walk, i.e., to find “the way,” he learns to present “truth” through his physical organism, and he learns to bring “life” from the spirit into expression in his body. No more significant re-interpretation seems possible of the words “Except ye become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And momentous is that saying in which the ego-being of the Christ comes into expression thus, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.” Just as, unknown to a child, the higher spirit-forces are fashioning its organism to become the bodily expression of the way, the truth and the life, so the spirit of man, through being interpenetrated with the Christ, gradually becomes the conscious vehicle of the way, the truth and the life. He is thereby making himself, in the course of his earthly development, into that force which bears sway within him as a child, when he is not consciously its vehicle.\nThis saying about the way, the truth and the life is capable of opening the doors of eternity. It sounds to man out of the depths of his soul, if his self-knowledge is true and real.\n\nSuch reflections as these open up, in a double sense, the vision of the spiritual guidance of the individual and of collective humanity. As human beings we are able, through self-knowledge, to find the Christ within us as the guide Whom, since His life on earth, we can always reach, because He is always in man. And further, if we apply to the historical records that we have apprehended without them, we discover their real nature. They express historically something which is revealed of itself in the depths of the soul. They are therefore to be accounted as guiding humanity in the same direction as the soul itself is proceeding.\n\nIf we thus understand the suggestion of eternity in the words, “I am the way, the truth and the life,” we cannot feel ourselves justified in asking, “Why does a person who has passed through many incarnations always re-enter life as a child?” For it becomes evident that this apparent imperfection is an ever-recurring reminder of the Highest that is in man. And we cannot be reminded often enough, at any rate each time we enter earthly life is not too often to be reminded, of the great fact of what man really is with reference to that Being who underlies all earthly existence, without being touched by its imperfections.\n\nIt is not well to make many definitions or summaries in occult science or theosophy, or indeed in occultism generally. It is better to give a description, and to try and call forth a feeling of what really exists. On this account we are now attempting to induce a feeling of what distinguishes the first three years of human life, and of the way in which this is related to the light that streams from the cross on Golgotha. The meaning of this feeling is that an impulse is passing through human evolution, and that through this impulse the Pauline saying, “Not I but the Christ in me,” will become a fact. We have only to know what man is in reality, in order to be able to proceed from such knowledge to insight into the nature of the Christ. When once, however, we have arrived at the Christ-idea through true observation of humanity, we know that we discover the Christ in the best way if we first look for Him in ourselves, and if we then return to the Bible records, these are for the first time rightly valued. And no one prizes the Bible more, or more consciously, than one who has found the Christ in this way. It is possible to imagine a being, let us say an inhabitant of Mars, descending to earth, without ever having heard of the Christ and His work. Much that has taken place on earth would be incomprehensible to the Martian; much that interests people nowadays would not interest him. But it would interest him to discover the central impulse of earthly evolution, i.e., the Christ-idea, as it is expressed in human nature itself.\nOne who has grasped this, is able for the first time rightly to understand the Bible, for he finds expressed there in a marvellous way what he has previously observed in himself, and he says: It is not necessary to have been brought up with any special reverence for the Gospel; they need only be presented to me, a fully-conscious human being, to stand revealed in all their greatness, by means of what I have learnt through occult science.\n\nIt is indeed not too much to say that a time will come when it will be recognized by people who have learned through occult science rightly to appreciate the contents of the Gospels, that these are guides of the human race in a sense which is more just to those writings than people have hitherto been to them. It is only through knowledge of human nature itself that humanity will learn to see what is latent in those profound records. It will then be said: If there is to be found in the Gospels that which forms an integral part of human nature, it must have come from the people who wrote these documents on earth. Therefore what genuine reflection brings home to us about our own lives, the more so the older we grow must hold especially good with regard to those writers. We ourselves have done many things which we only understand years afterwards, and in the writers of the Gospels may be seen people who wrote out of the higher self which works in man during childhood, so that the Gospels are writings emanating from the wisdom which moulds human nature. Man through his body is a manifestation of spirit, and the Gospels are such a manifestation in writing.\n\nOn this assumption the idea of inspiration regains its true and loftier meaning. Just as higher forces are at work on the brain during the first three years of childhood, so there were higher forces from spiritual worlds impressed on the souls of the Evangelists, under the influence of which they wrote the Gospels. The spiritual guidance of humanity is expressed in such a fact as this. For the human race must surely be guided, if within it there are people working who write records under the influence of the same powers that are at work on the moulding of man in profound wisdom. And just as the individual says or does things which he only understands at a later period of life, so collective humanity has produced in the Evangelists means of revelation which can only be understood by degrees. The farther humanity progresses, the greater will be the understanding of these records. The individual can feel spiritual guidance within himself; and collective humanity can feel it in those of its members who work as did the writers of the Gospels.\nThe idea thus gained of the guidance of humanity may be extended in many directions. Let us suppose that a man finds disciples, a few people who follow him. Such an one will soon become aware, through genuine self-knowledge, that the very fact of his finding disciples gives him the feeling that what he has to say does not originate with himself. The case is rather this, that spiritual powers in higher worlds wish to communicate with the disciples, and find in the Teacher the fitting instrument for their manifestation.\nThe thought will suggest itself to such a man: when I was a child I worked on myself by the aid of forces proceeding from the spiritual world, and what I am now able to give, of my best, must also proceed from higher worlds; I may not look upon it as belonging to my ordinary consciousness. Such a man may in fact say: something demonic, something like a “daimon” using the word in the sense of a good spiritual power is working out of a spiritual world through me on my disciples.\n\nSocrates felt something of this kind. Plato tells us that he spoke of his “daimon” as of the one who led and guided him. Many attempts have been made to explain this “daimon” of Socrates, but it can only be explained by supposing that Socrates was able to feel something like that which results from the above reflections. Then we are able to understand that throughout the three or four centuries during which the Socratic principle was active in Greece, a state of feeling permeated the Greek world through Socrates, which prepared the way for another great event. The feeling that man, as he now is, is not the whole of what comes through from higher worlds, this feeling went on working. The best of those in whom it was present were those who afterwards best understood the words, “Not I, but the Christ in me.” For they could say to themselves: Socrates used to speak of a being working as a “daimon” from higher worlds; the Christ-ideal makes clear what Socrates meant. Only Socrates could not as yet speak of Christ, because in his time no one was able to find the Christ-nature within himself.\n\nHere again we feel something of the spiritual guidance of the race, for nothing can be established in the world without preparation. Why was it that Paul found his best disciples in Greece? Because the ground had been prepared there by the teaching of Socrates and the state of feeling that has been described. That is to say, what happens in human evolution may be traced back to events which operated previously, and made people ripe for what was afterwards to be brought to bear upon them. Do we not feel here how far the guiding impulse passing through human evolution extends and how at the right moment it places people where they will be best used to further evolution? In such facts is manifested the guidance of the human race in a general way.\n[1] The vitality of the human organism is maintained at the transition from childhood to later life, because the organism is capable of change at that period. Later in life, it is no longer susceptible of change, and on this account cannot continue to exist with that other Self.",

                            "text": "In \"Lecture I\" of \"The Spiritual Guidance of Man and of Mankind,\" Rudolf Steiner delves into the profound and intricate relationship between the human self and its spiritual counterpart, emphasizing the transformative journey from birth through childhood and into adulthood, and its implications for personal and collective evolution.\n\nSteiner begins by exploring the duality within human nature, where individuals recognize a more profound, powerful self beyond their conscious thoughts, feelings, and will. This realization leads to the discovery that many actions and experiences in life are only fully understood with the passage of time, suggesting the guidance of a higher wisdom at work within us. This wisdom, he argues, instills a sense of protection and confidence, revealing that our conscious achievements are but a fraction of our true contributions to the world.\n\nThe text further examines the critical role of early childhood in human development. Steiner points out that during the initial years of life, individuals accomplish significant feats—achieving physical equilibrium, learning to speak, and beginning to think—through the influence of a wisdom that transcends conscious understanding. This period is marked by a close connection with spiritual realms, which gradually shifts as the ego develops and memory forms. Despite this shift, the higher wisdom that guided early development continues to influence individuals, albeit in a less direct manner.\n\nSteiner introduces the concept that human beings are not fully isolated entities but are continuously guided by spiritual forces. This guidance is most evident in childhood but extends throughout life, manifesting in ideals, artistic creations, and the body's natural healing abilities. These forces, he suggests, stem from a deeper, divine aspect of humanity that seeks expression and realization.\n\nThe lecture delves into the reasons why this higher guidance is most potent in early childhood, explaining that prolonged direct influence would inhibit the development of ego-consciousness and individual autonomy. However, the ultimate goal of human evolution is to consciously reconnect with these spiritual forces, transcending the limitations imposed by the physical body and the material world.\n\nSteiner discusses the role of reincarnation and the evolution of the human race, emphasizing that each incarnation offers opportunities for spiritual advancement. He highlights the significance of Christ's life and teachings as a model for understanding the divine potential within every individual. The Christ figure embodies the highest human ideal, demonstrating the possibility of living in full harmony with the spiritual forces that guide us from birth.\n\nIn conclusion, Steiner's lecture invites readers to recognize and embrace the spiritual guidance inherent in their being. By acknowledging the divine aspect of humanity and striving to align with it, individuals can transcend their limitations and contribute to the collective evolution of mankind. The text ultimately calls for a deeper understanding of the spiritual dimensions of human existence, encouraging a journey towards self-realization and unity with the higher spiritual realms.",

Rudolf Steiner explains that when a person becomes aware that they have done things in former years which they are only now beginning to understand, a specific feeling arises in the soul. This feeling is described as follows: \"The man feels himself protected by a good power, which rules in the depths of his own being; he begins to have more and more confidence in the fact that really, in the highest sense of the word, he is not alone in the world, and that everything which he understands, and is consciously able to do, is after all but a small part of what he really accomplished in the world.\"\n\nThis realization fosters a sense of confidence because it reassures the individual that their actions and decisions, even those not fully understood at the time, were under the guidance of a wisdom greater than their own. It mitigates the fear of making mistakes or being entirely responsible for one's fate, knowing that a higher, benevolent power is at work.\n\nFurthermore, this awareness alleviates feelings of solitude by instilling the understanding that one is never truly alone. The sense that one is part of a larger, guided process and connected to a higher power provides comfort and a feeling of being supported and watched over. This connection to something greater than oneself can reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, reinforcing the idea that one's life is part of a larger, meaningful tapestry.",

These tasks are:\n\n1. **The Equilibrium of Their Own Body in Space**: Steiner explains that unlike animals, which are destined from the outset to develop their equilibrium in space in a certain way based on their species (e.g., climbers, swimmers), humans must work upon themselves to achieve this equilibrium. He states, \"It is significant that man should have to work upon himself, in order to make, out of a being that cannot walk at all, one that can walk erect\" and further emphasizes that \"It is man himself who gives himself his vertical position, or his equilibrium in space.\"\n\n2. **Speech**: The second task is learning to speak, which enables humans to come into relation with their fellow humans and become vehicles of the spiritual life that interpenetrates the world primarily through humans. Steiner contrasts this with inherited traits that do not depend on a person's social environment, highlighting that \"But he only learns to talk, when his soul’s inner being, i.e., that which is carried on from one life to another, is stimulated.\"\n\n3. **Life Within the World of Thought**: The third task involves the development of the brain as the instrument of thought. Steiner points out that the human soul, before it is fully conscious, works upon the brain to make it an instrument for exercising all the abilities, aptitudes, qualities, etc., which appertain to the soul as the result of its former earthly lives. This task is described as \"the life within the world of thought itself.\"\n\nThese tasks differentiate humans from animals in several key ways. Firstly, the ability to achieve equilibrium in space through personal effort, rather than being predestined by species-specific organization, highlights the unique adaptability and developmental potential of humans. Secondly, the acquisition of speech as a means of engaging with the spiritual and social dimensions of existence underlines the profound relational and communicative capacities that distinguish humans. Lastly, the conscious development of thought through the deliberate shaping of the brain's capabilities reflects the deep intellectual and creative potential that is a hallmark of human existence. Collectively, these tasks underscore the unique path of human development, characterized by self-determined physical coordination, complex communication, and intellectual engagement with the world, setting humans apart from the instinct-driven and pre-determined developmental pathways of animals.",

This connection facilitates the development of the individual in ways that are not fully conscious but are guided by a higher wisdom, contributing to the formation of the person's physical, linguistic, and cognitive abilities, as well as their spiritual development.\n\n1. **Physical Development**: The text explains that during the first years of childhood, the human soul works on the physical body with a wisdom that surpasses anything the individual can consciously achieve later in life. For example, \"the human soul, before it is fully conscious, works upon the brain so as to make it an instrument for exercising all the abilities, aptitudes, qualities, etc., which appertain to the soul as the result of its former earthly lives.\" This indicates that the soul's connection to the spiritual worlds enables it to shape the physical brain in a way that prepares it for the individual's future tasks and abilities.\n\n2. **Learning Fundamental Skills**: The text highlights three crucial skills that a person teaches themselves during early childhood, facilitated by their soul's connection to the spiritual worlds: maintaining equilibrium in space, speech, and thought. These are described as monumental tasks that the soul accomplishes \"from subconscious motives, during the first years of childhood.\" This connection to the spiritual worlds allows the child to develop these essential human capabilities in a manner that seems to transcend ordinary learning processes.\n\n3. **Spiritual and Cognitive Development**: The connection to the spiritual worlds during early childhood is also described as enabling the child to perform \"momentous things\" and work on themselves \"in the spirit of the highest wisdom.\" This suggests that the spiritual connection not only influences physical and practical skill development but also enriches the child's spiritual and cognitive growth, laying a foundation for their understanding of the world and themselves.\n\n4. **Guidance and Protection**: The text also speaks to a sense of being guided and protected by a higher power, which becomes apparent when individuals reflect on their actions and growth. This sense of guidance and protection is attributed to the connection with the spiritual worlds, which continues to influence individuals beyond childhood, helping them to develop beyond their conscious understanding and abilities.\n\n5. **Influence on Later Life**: The influence of the early childhood connection to the spiritual worlds extends into later life, as adults may find that they are only able to understand the reasons behind their earlier actions after many years. This delayed understanding suggests that the actions were guided by a higher wisdom accessible during childhood due to the closer connection to the spiritual worlds.\n\nIn summary, the connection between the human soul and the spiritual worlds during early childhood plays a crucial role in a person's development, influencing their physical, linguistic, cognitive, and spiritual growth. This connection provides a foundation of wisdom and guidance that continues to affect the individual throughout their life, even as the direct awareness of this connection fades.",

This realization suggests that the forces and wisdom that guided them in early childhood, beyond their conscious understanding, continue to influence their development and actions in later years. \"If at a later stage of life we feel that we did something years before which we are only now able to understand, it is just because we previously let ourselves be guided by higher wisdom, and only after the lapse of years have we attained to an understanding of the reasons of our conduct.\"\n\n2. **Influence of Higher Spirituality**: The text explains that all ideals, artistic creations, and natural healing forces within the human body, which adjust injuries and maintain health, do not stem from ordinary intellect but from the deeper forces active during early childhood. These forces, which are at work when a child learns to walk, speak, and think, continue to operate in later years, suggesting a sustained influence of higher spirituality that was more directly accessible in early childhood. \"All ideals and artistic creations which man is able to produce, as well as all the natural healing forces in his own body...all these powers do not proceed from ordinary intellect, but from those deeper forces which in our earliest years are at work on our equilibrium in space, on the formation of our larynx and on the brain.\"\n\n3. **Guidance by Higher Wisdom**: The text posits that in early childhood, individuals are guided by a wisdom that is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom they can attain in later years. This higher wisdom, though becoming obscured as the individual gains consciousness, continues to guide them subtly throughout their life. The implication is that the wisdom that so profoundly shapes a person in their earliest years never truly leaves them but continues to influence their growth and understanding. \"Man works on himself by means of a wisdom which is not within him. That wisdom is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom of later years.\"\n\n4. **Connection with the Spiritual World**: Early in life, individuals are in much closer connection with the spiritual worlds than in later years. This connection, while becoming less direct as one grows older, still influences an individual's development and understanding. The forces from the spiritual world that help shape a person's physical and spiritual being in childhood continue to play a role in their life, guiding and influencing them in ways that may not always be consciously recognized. \"The higher wisdom works from out of the spiritual world deep into the bodily part of man, so that man is able by its means to form his brain out of spirit.\"\n\nIn summary, the forces that work on a human being during early childhood—manifested through higher wisdom, spiritual connection, and the development of fundamental human capabilities—continue to influence them in later years by guiding their understanding, growth, and healing beyond the realm of conscious intellect.",

According to the text, human nature has arrived at its current form through the action of various forces, including those of the Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings. These beings have, \"in a certain way, become worse than it need have been if those forces only had been active within it which proceed from the spiritual rulers of the cosmos who desire to evolve man along straight lines.\" The consequences of their influence include the introduction of sorrow, disease, and even death into human existence. This deviation from the ideal path is attributed to the fact that \"besides the beings who are evolving man in a straight line forwards, there are also ruling the Luciferic and Ahrimanic spirits, who are continually crossing the line of straightforward, progressive development.\"\n\nFurthermore, the text explains that during early childhood, the Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces have but little influence over a person. Their impact becomes more significant as the individual grows and begins to shape their conscious life, suggesting that the purest form of human nature, less tainted by these adversarial forces, is present at birth and during the early years of childhood. This period of life is characterized by a closer connection to the spiritual worlds and the working of higher wisdom within the individual, which is gradually obscured as the person grows older and more influenced by the material world and the forces of Lucifer and Ahriman.\n\nIn summary, the Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces impact human nature by steering it away from its ideal evolutionary trajectory, introducing elements of suffering and imperfection that were not originally intended by the spiritual cosmos. The consequences of their influence are most notably sorrow, disease, and death, which become more pronounced as the individual grows older and further removed from the pure, spiritually connected state of early childhood.",

These forces, embodying a higher wisdom, are more comprehensive and mightier than any conscious wisdom we acquire in later years. The text suggests that during the first years of life, individuals are in much closer connection with the spiritual worlds and are guided by a wisdom that is beyond their conscious understanding. This wisdom works deeply within the bodily and soul aspects of a person, enabling significant developmental achievements such as the attainment of equilibrium, speech, and thought.\n\nThe statement emphasizes the necessity of becoming like little children, which implies regaining that direct, unobstructed connection to the spiritual forces and wisdom that guide us in early childhood. This does not mean regressing to a childlike state in a literal sense but rather cultivating qualities such as openness, humility, and a readiness to be guided by higher wisdom—the wisdom that operates within us without our conscious intervention during our early years. It's about allowing the larger spirituality that rules within us to have the same relationship to our consciousness as it had to our unconscious life in early childhood.\n\nMoreover, the text elaborates on the idea that through successive earthly lives, the aim is to gradually transform the whole individual, including the conscious part, into an expression of the powers ruling under the influence of the spiritual world during the first years of life. This transformation is essential for spiritual development and for entering the \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" which can be interpreted as achieving a state of spiritual enlightenment or a conscious, harmonious connection with the divine or higher spiritual realities.\n\nIn summary, the significance of the statement in the context of spiritual development is about striving to reconnect with and consciously integrate the divine wisdom and spiritual forces that guide us in early childhood, thereby advancing our spiritual evolution and moving closer to a state of enlightenment or the \"Kingdom of Heaven.\"",

Rudolf Steiner explains that \"the passing of the individual through successive incarnations is of importance for the collective evolution of the human race. The latter has advanced through successive lives in the past, and is still advancing, and parallel with it the earth too is moving forwards in its evolution.\" This indicates that each incarnation is not only a step in the personal development of an individual soul but also a part of a larger, collective process of evolution that encompasses both humanity as a whole and the planet Earth.\n\nSteiner further elaborates on the significance of this process by discussing the eventual end of Earth's physical existence and the importance of individuals having progressed sufficiently by that time. He states, \"The time will come when the earth will have reached the end of its career. Then the earthly planet will fall away as a physical entity from the sum-total of human souls, just as the human body falls away from the spirit at death, when, in order to continue living, the soul enters the spiritual realm which is adapted for it between death and re-birth.\" This passage underscores the interconnectedness of individual evolution and the planet's destiny, suggesting that the culmination of Earth's evolution and the collective progress of humanity are intrinsically linked.\n\nMoreover, Steiner points out that the forces which prevent humans from enduring the spiritual influences of early childhood throughout their lives originate from the Earth's substance. These forces, associated with the physical world, are part of what humanity must transcend through successive incarnations to reach a state where the individual can fully embrace and live with the spiritual forces active during childhood. He explains, \"Now those forces which prevent man from being able to endure the forces working upon him during early childhood come out of the substance of the earth.\"\n\nIn summary, the concept of successive incarnations is central to the collective evolution of the human race and the planet Earth in Steiner's philosophy. It is through the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that individuals and humanity as a whole learn, grow, and progress, moving towards a future where the spiritual evolution achieved allows for transcendence beyond the physical limitations of Earth. This process is seen as essential for both the individual's spiritual development and the eventual evolution of the planet itself.",

These forces are described as being more powerful and comprehensive than any conscious wisdom available in later years, working from out of the spiritual world deep into the bodily part of man, enabling the formation of the brain out of spirit. This early influence is characterized by a wisdom that is mightier than the conscious wisdom of later years, suggesting that what is within us is not only a higher self gradually evolving but is something higher already present, serving as the motive cause for often developing beyond ourselves (as stated in the text, \"Our share in higher spirituality enters our physical life and accompanies us throughout it\").\n\nThe text explains that during early childhood, human beings are in much closer connection with the spiritual worlds of the higher hierarchies than in later life. This connection allows for the development of crucial aspects such as the equilibrium of the body in space, speech, and the capacity for thought, all of which are foundational to human existence and are achieved with a wisdom that surpasses later conscious efforts. This early period of life is marked by an individual working on themselves \"in the spirit of the highest wisdom,\" a time when the soul and entire being are more directly influenced by the spiritual world.\n\nHowever, the text also acknowledges human imperfection, attributing it to the influences of Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces, which complicate and challenge the straightforward, progressive development desired by the spiritual rulers of the cosmos. It is suggested that the early childhood forces, if retained in full force beyond early childhood, would be too overwhelming for the human organism weakened by these opposing forces. This presents a picture of human nature as being inherently flawed but also possessing an innate potential for perfection, rooted in the divine or higher wisdom active in early childhood.\n\nThe potential for human perfection is seen in the aspiration to reconnect consciously with these higher forces, to become more like the state of early childhood in terms of being in harmony with the spiritual world. The text posits that the ultimate goal of human evolution is to make the whole individual, including the conscious part, an expression of the powers ruling under the influence of the spiritual world during early childhood. This is framed as a gradual process, achievable through successive earthly lives and spiritual preparation, aiming to enable individuals to bear and consciously work with the spiritual forces that are too potent to be directly engaged in ordinary life.\n\nIn summary, the higher forces that work upon human nature during early childhood are depicted as fundamental to the understanding of human imperfection and the potential for perfection. They represent a divine wisdom and connection to the spiritual world that humans initially embody and are later challenged to consciously re-engage with as part of their spiritual evolution and quest for perfection.",

This relationship is elucidated through the notion that at Jesus's baptism, the ego of Jesus of Nazareth was replaced by \"that higher Self of humanity which usually works with cosmic wisdom on a child without its knowledge.\" This event signifies a moment where the higher self, typically operative in the background of human development and particularly active during the early years of childhood, was fully and consciously embodied in an adult human form. \n\nSteiner explains that in early childhood, the human being is under the influence of spiritual forces from the spiritual world, which work on the child with a wisdom that is not yet conscious to the individual. These forces are responsible for significant developments such as the attainment of equilibrium, the development of speech, and the capacity for thought. This work is done in a manner that is more profound and wise than anything the individual can consciously achieve later in life. \n\nAt the baptism in the river Jordan, according to Steiner, the ego that had been part of Jesus of Nazareth left, and in its place, the higher Self, which is usually at work unconsciously within humanity during early childhood, entered into Jesus in a fully conscious form. This higher Self is described as being in connection with the spiritual hierarchies and operates with cosmic wisdom. The necessity arose that this Self, now fully conscious and embodied in Jesus, could only live for three years in the human organism due to the profound and powerful nature of the forces it embodied. \n\nThis event is significant because it represents a historical manifestation of the higher self's potential within humanity, demonstrating that the wisdom and forces active in the early years of life, and generally beyond the reach of adult conscious understanding, can be fully realized and lived within the human experience. It symbolizes the ultimate potential for humanity to evolve and embody the higher spiritual wisdom that guides its development from birth and beyond. \n\nSteiner connects this event to the broader spiritual evolution of humanity, suggesting that the aim of human development is to become increasingly conscious of and aligned with this higher wisdom that works within us. The baptism of Jesus of Nazareth and the subsequent three years of his life embody the possibility of such an evolution towards a conscious relationship with the spiritual forces that guide human development.",

These forces, which are described as being more comprehensive and mightier than any conscious wisdom of later years, work from out of the spiritual world deep into the bodily part of man, enabling the formation of the brain, the equilibrium of the body in space, and the development of speech and thought (paragraphs discussing early childhood development and the spiritual forces at work).\n\nThe text states, \"The recognition of the forces working in human nature during childhood is the recognition of the Christ in man\" (paragraph discussing the recognition of the Christ in man). This statement encapsulates the relationship by suggesting that understanding and acknowledging the profound and wise forces that guide human development in the early years is akin to recognizing the presence and influence of the Christ within each individual. This recognition is not merely an intellectual acknowledgment but a profound spiritual realization that connects the individual to the broader spiritual realms and the workings of the Christ force within human evolution.\n\nMoreover, the text elaborates that this recognition leads to the further perception that the Christ once really dwelt on earth in a human body, bridging the gap between the spiritual forces active in early childhood and the historical incarnation of the Christ. It is suggested that genuine clairvoyant knowledge of self leads individuals in the present day to discover powers within the human soul that emanate from the Christ, indicating a direct link between the spiritual forces active during childhood and the Christ being (paragraphs discussing clairvoyant perception and the Christ in man).\n\nIn summary, the relationship between recognizing the forces working in human nature during childhood and recognizing the Christ in man is foundational to the text's exploration of spiritual development and human evolution. It posits that the early childhood experience, under the guidance of higher spiritual forces, is a direct manifestation of the Christ force within humanity, and that recognizing this connection is crucial for spiritual understanding and development.",

According to the text, \"These powers are at work during the first three years of childhood without any action being taken by the human being. In later life they may be called into action, if the Christ be sought within the soul by inner meditation.\" This indicates that through a deep, introspective understanding of one's own soul and its development, one can recognize the presence and influence of Christ-like powers that have been operating within since early childhood.\n\nFurthermore, the text explains that there was a time when no inner meditation could lead a person to the Christ within themselves. This changed after the earthly life of Christ, making it possible for individuals to find the Christ within through self-reflection and meditation: \"In the interval between that past time when man could not find the Christ in himself, and the present time when he can find him, there took place Christ’s earthly life. And that life itself is the cause of man’s being able to find the Christ in himself in the manner that has been pointed out.\" This suggests that the historical existence and actions of Christ have opened a pathway for individuals to connect with these divine aspects of their soul through clairvoyant self-knowledge.\n\nThus, genuine clairvoyant knowledge of self facilitates the discovery of Christ-like powers within the human soul by enabling individuals to perceive and activate the spiritual forces that have been part of their being since childhood, influenced by the life and teachings of Christ.",

This higher wisdom, which is mightier, works from out of the spiritual world deep into the bodily part of man, enabling the formation of the brain out of spirit. This process is likened to the presence and action of Christ within every human being, suggesting that \"the Christ can be discerned in every human being\" and that the recognition of the forces working in human nature during childhood is essentially the recognition of the Christ in man.\n\nFurthermore, the text elaborates on how the historical fact of Jesus of Nazareth embodying that higher Self of humanity, which usually works with cosmic wisdom on a child without its knowledge, for three years after his baptism in the river Jordan, serves as a direct manifestation of this ideal. This period in Christ Jesus's life, where he lived with the higher Self in complete conscious development, symbolizes the ultimate human ideal. It represents the embodiment of 'the way, the truth, and the life'—the very essence of what humans learn from the spirit in their early childhood: to walk physically ('the way'), to form truth through speech ('the truth'), and to bring life from the spirit into expression in their body ('the life').\n\nThe text suggests that just as the higher spirit-forces fashion a child's organism to become the bodily expression of the way, the truth, and the life, so the spirit of man, through being interpenetrated with the Christ, gradually becomes the conscious vehicle of these elements. This transformation is seen as the path towards becoming that force which bears sway within as a child, when one is not consciously its vehicle. \n\nIn essence, the life of Christ Jesus exemplifies the highest human ideal of becoming consciously connected to and expressive of the higher wisdom and spiritual forces that guide us in early childhood. His life demonstrates how humans can embody 'the way, the truth, and the life' through a conscious relationship with the spiritual world, thereby making themselves into instruments of the divine wisdom that shapes human nature from its inception.",

These reflections, as detailed in the text, reveal the intricate relationship between the individual's development and the overarching spiritual forces that guide humanity's evolution.\n\nFirstly, the text describes how an individual, through self-examination and reflection, can become aware of a \"second self\" or a higher power within, which is initially perceived as a lower entity but later recognized as a guiding force that has led the individual to act with wisdom beyond their conscious understanding at the time. This realization fosters a sense of being protected and guided by a \"good power\" within, which is an essential aspect of individual spiritual guidance (paragraphs 1-3).\n\nThe reflections further elaborate on the significant accomplishments of the human soul during early childhood, which are attributed to a wisdom that is beyond the individual's conscious intelligence. This wisdom, deeply connected with the spiritual world, guides the individual in developing fundamental human capabilities such as equilibrium, speech, and thought. This process underscores the idea that individuals are not alone but are continuously guided by higher spiritual forces from their inception into the physical world (paragraphs 4-11).\n\nOn a collective level, the text introduces the Christ-idea as a central impulse in human evolution, emphasizing that the recognition of the forces working in human nature during childhood is akin to recognizing the Christ within every individual. This recognition leads to the profound realization that the Christ once dwelled on earth in a human body, embodying the highest human ideal and guiding humanity towards spiritual evolution. The historical fact of Christ's life and teachings serves as a model for individual and collective spiritual guidance, demonstrating how to live in harmony with the higher wisdom that guides us from within (paragraphs 12-26).\n\nMoreover, the reflections suggest that the spiritual guidance of humanity is not only about individual enlightenment but also about the collective advancement towards understanding and embodying the principles of \"the way, the truth, and the life.\" This guidance is manifested through the teachings and life of Christ, which serve as a blueprint for humanity's spiritual journey. The text posits that through self-knowledge and the pursuit of the Christ within, individuals can contribute to the collective spiritual evolution of humanity, moving closer to realizing the highest ideals of human existence (paragraphs 27-29).\n\nIn conclusion, the reflections on human nature and the Christ-idea contribute to the understanding of spiritual guidance by highlighting the interconnectedness of individual development with the collective evolution of humanity. They reveal that through recognizing and aligning with the higher wisdom and forces at work within us from childhood, and by following the example set by Christ, individuals can navigate their spiritual journey more consciously, contributing to the broader spiritual guidance and evolution of humanity.",

This concept is deeply explored in the text, emphasizing the profound work carried out by the soul in early childhood, under the guidance of higher spiritual forces, before the ego becomes fully conscious. \n\nThe text explains, \"Man works on himself by means of a wisdom which is not within him. That wisdom is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom of later years.\" This highlights the idea that in early childhood, individuals are more directly influenced by spiritual wisdom, which shapes their most fundamental human capabilities—such as walking, speaking, and thinking—without their conscious effort or understanding. This period of life is described as one where \"the individual is then working out of a self which is still in direct connection with higher worlds,\" indicating a closer proximity to spiritual realms and forces.\n\nFurthermore, the text states, \"It is not well to make many definitions or summaries in occult science or theosophy, or indeed in occultism generally. It is better to give a description, and to try and call forth a feeling of what really exists.\" This approach underscores the importance of experiencing and recognizing the spiritual essence within oneself as a way to understand the profound connection between the individual's early childhood experiences and their spiritual origins.\n\nThe reminder of the highest that is in man through the experience of re-entering life as a child is encapsulated in the idea that \"this apparent imperfection is an ever-recurring reminder of the Highest that is in man.\" It serves as a continuous prompt, with each incarnation, of the individual's spiritual nature and the divine guidance that shapes human development from the earliest stages of life. This process underscores the interconnectedness of the individual's spiritual journey with the broader evolution of humanity and the spiritual world, reinforcing the notion that humans are not merely physical beings but are deeply rooted in and guided by spiritual forces.",

The significance of understanding them through knowledge of human nature lies in the recognition that the forces working in human nature during childhood are the same forces that once dwelt on earth in a human body, specifically in the body of Jesus of Nazareth. This understanding leads to the realization that the Christ, or the \"higher\" ego connected with spiritual hierarchies, can be discerned in every human being.\n\nThe text explains, \"If we thus understand the suggestion of eternity in the words, 'I am the way, the truth and the life,' we cannot feel ourselves justified in asking, 'Why does a person who has passed through many incarnations always re-enter life as a child?'\" This indicates that the apparent imperfection of re-entering life as a child is actually a reminder of the highest that is in man, connecting to the essence of the Gospels and the teachings of Christ. \n\nFurthermore, the text states, \"If there is to be found in the Gospels that which forms an integral part of human nature, it must have come from the people who wrote these documents on earth.\" This suggests that the Gospels are writings emanating from the wisdom which molds human nature, and understanding them through the lens of human nature allows humanity to see what is latent in those profound records. The Gospels, therefore, are not just historical documents but are deeply intertwined with the spiritual development and nature of humanity itself.\n\nIn essence, the Gospels guide humanity by reflecting the spiritual forces active in human development, particularly during childhood, and understanding them through knowledge of human nature reveals the presence and work of Christ within every individual. This insight fosters a deeper appreciation for the Gospels and their teachings, highlighting their role as spiritual guides that resonate with the intrinsic spiritual journey of every human being.",

This connection is explored in the text through the examination of how Socrates' idea of a guiding 'daimon' can be seen as a precursor to the Christ-ideal, which emphasizes the presence of Christ within the individual as a guiding force.\n\nSocrates is described as having spoken of his 'daimon' as \"the one who led and guided him.\" This concept is interpreted as Socrates feeling \"something like that which results from the above reflections,\" suggesting that Socrates was aware of a guiding force emanating from the spiritual world, working through him. The text suggests that this understanding by Socrates laid the groundwork for the later acceptance and understanding of the Christ-ideal, which articulates a more defined notion of spiritual guidance within the individual.\n\nThe text states, \"The feeling that man, as he now is, is not the whole of what comes through from higher worlds, this feeling went on working. The best of those in whom it was present were those who afterwards best understood the words, 'Not I, but the Christ in me.'\" This passage indicates that the intuitive understanding that there is more to human existence than the physical and conscious self, which Socrates hinted at with his concept of the 'daimon,' evolved into a more explicit recognition of the Christ within as a source of guidance and wisdom. \n\nFurthermore, the text explains that the groundwork laid by Socrates and the feeling he propagated \"prepared the way for another great event,\" referring to the acceptance and understanding of the Christ-ideal. It suggests a continuity in spiritual guidance, where the teachings and intuitions of earlier thinkers and spiritual leaders prepare humanity for deeper and more explicit understandings of spiritual truths. \n\nIn summary, the relationship between Socrates' 'daimon' and the Christ-ideal reveals a developmental trajectory in the spiritual guidance of the human race, showing how earlier concepts and intuitions about spiritual guidance can evolve and become more explicitly understood in later spiritual teachings. This relationship underscores the idea that spiritual guidance has been a continuous and evolving presence in human history, guiding individuals and humanity as a whole towards greater spiritual understanding and development.",

He suggests that upon closer scrutiny, individuals may realize that their second self, which initially seemed inferior to their conscious self, holds a deeper significance. As people reflect on their past actions and experiences throughout their lives, they may uncover a profound realization. With age, this discovery becomes more profound. Steiner highlights that actions taken years ago may only be truly comprehended in later stages of life when one's intelligence has matured. This introspective journey emphasizes the evolving nature of self-awareness and the continuous growth and understanding that comes with the passage of time.",

By reflecting on past actions and experiences, one can uncover a deeper understanding of oneself, realizing that past behaviors may only be comprehended later in life when intelligence has matured.

It is easy to see that we should not make much progress in life if we had to accomplish everything we have to do, in full consciousness, with our intelligence taking note of every circumstance affecting us. In order to see this theoretically, we have only to reflect as follows: In what section of his life does a human being perform those acts which are really most important as regards his own existence? When does he act most wisely for himself? He does this from about the time of his birth up to that period to which his memory goes back when in later life he surveys his earthly existence. If he recalls what he did three, four or five years ago, and then goes farther and farther back, he comes at last to a certain point in childhood, beyond which memory cannot go. What lies beyond it may be told by parents or others, but a man’s own recollection only extends to a certain point in the past. That point is the moment at which the individual felt himself to be an ego. In the lives of people whose memory is limited to the normal, there must always be such a point, but previously to it, the human soul has worked in the wisest possible manner on the individual, and never afterwards, when man has gained consciousness, can he accomplish such vast and magnificent work on himself as he carries out, from subconscious motives, during the first years of childhood.",

This realization can lead to a sense of being guided by a higher power within oneself and can increase one's confidence in the interconnectedness of their experiences. Steiner suggests that reflecting on past actions can help individuals recognize the wisdom of their subconscious mind, especially during the early years of childhood when significant inner work is done without conscious awareness.

When a person is born, their physical brain is initially undeveloped, and it is the soul's task to refine and shape the brain into an instrument capable of manifesting the soul's abilities and qualities acquired from previous lives. The soul, operating before full consciousness is attained, intricately works on the body to enable it to express the soul's attributes, a process guided by a wisdom that surpasses what the individual can consciously achieve later in life.",

The first is the equilibrium of his own body in space. The man of the present day entirely overlooks the meaning of this statement, which touches upon one of the most essential differences between man and animals. An animal is destined from the outset to develop its equilibrium in space in a certain way; one animal is destined to be a climber, another a swimmer, etc. An animal is so organized from the beginning as to be able to bear itself rightly in space, and this is the case with all animals up to and including the mammals most resembling man. If zoologists would ponder this fact, they would lay less emphasis on the number of similar bones and muscles in man and animals, etc., for this is of much less account than the fact that man is not endowed at the outset with the complete equipment for his conditions of equilibrium. He has first to form them out of the sum total of his being. It is significant that man should have to work upon himself, in order to make, out of a being that cannot walk at all, one that can walk erect. It is man himself who gives himself his vertical position, or his equilibrium in space. He brings himself into relation with the force of gravitation. It will obviously be easy for anyone taking a superficial view of the matter to question this statement, with apparently good reason. It may be said that man is just as much organized for his erect walk as, for instance, a climbing animal for climbing. But more accurate observation will show that it is the peculiarity of the animal’s organization that causes its position in space. In man it is the soul which brings itself into relation with space and controls the organization.",

The first aspect is understanding the equilibrium of his body in space, a concept often overlooked by modern man. Unlike animals, which are inherently equipped to maintain their balance in space based on their specific characteristics like climbing or swimming abilities, man has to actively develop his own equilibrium. This process involves man transforming himself from a being incapable of walking into an upright walker by consciously engaging with the force of gravity. While superficially this may be questioned, a deeper examination reveals that it is the soul of man that establishes his relationship with space and governs his bodily organization, distinguishing him from animals whose physical structures dictate their spatial orientation.",

Unlike animals that are inherently equipped for their specific modes of movement (climbing, swimming, etc.), humans have to actively work on themselves to achieve their vertical position and equilibrium in space. This process of self-transformation from a being that cannot walk at all to one that can walk erect is a crucial aspect of human evolution.\n\nThe paragraph emphasizes that it is the human soul that plays a central role in this process, as it is the soul that \"brings itself into relation with space and controls the organization.\" This underscores the idea that human evolution is not just a physical or biological process but also a spiritual one, where the soul is actively involved in shaping the physical form and abilities of the individual. This aspect of self-transformation and self-development through the interaction of the soul with the physical body distinguishes human evolution from that of animals, where such conscious self-modification is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the concept of equilibrium in space in relation to human evolution suggests that humans have a unique capacity for self-directed evolution, where the soul plays a crucial role in shaping physical abilities and characteristics. This highlights the deeper spiritual dimension of human development and evolution beyond mere physical adaptation, pointing towards a more complex and intentional process guided by the individual's inner spiritual forces.",

The paragraph highlights that man's ability to walk upright is a result of his own efforts and the influence of his soul on his physical organization. It emphasizes the significance of this process in shaping human existence and differentiating man from animals in terms of how equilibrium in space is achieved. Rudolf Steiner points out that man's vertical position is not predetermined like an animal's but is a result of his own development and interaction with the force of gravitation, controlled by his soul.\n\nIn summary, studying the process of man giving himself his vertical position in relation to space reveals the unique role of the human soul in shaping man's physical abilities and his relationship with the external world, setting him apart from animals whose equilibrium in space is predetermined by their physical organization.",

Through speech he comes into relation with his fellow-men. This relation makes him the vehicle of that spiritual life which interpenetrates the world primarily through man. Emphasis has often been laid, with good reason, on the fact that a human being removed, before he could speak, to a desert island, and kept apart from his fellows, would not learn to talk. On the other hand, what we receive by inheritance, what is implanted in us for use in later years and is subject to the principles of heredity, does not depend on a man’s dwelling with his fellows. For instance, his inherited conditions oblige him to change his teeth in his seventh year. If it were possible for him to grow up on a desert island, he would still change them then. But he only learns to talk, when his soul’s inner being, i.e., that which is carried on from one life to another, is stimulated. The germ, however, for the development of the larynx must be formed during the period at which man has not yet acquired his ego-consciousness. Before the time to which his memory goes back, he must plant the germ for developing his larynx, in order that this may become the organ of speech.",

Steiner emphasizes that the ability to speak is connected to the inner being of the soul that transcends individual lifetimes. He explains that the capacity for speech, including the development of the larynx, is initiated before the individual's memory extends, emphasizing the spiritual nature of this process.",

This second self is described as a good power that rules in the depths of his own being, providing protection and a sense of not being alone in the world. Through self-reflection and understanding the actions taken by this second self, the man gains confidence in a higher sense of existence beyond his conscious understanding.

Before the time to which his memory goes back, he must plant the germ for developing his larynx, in order that this may become the organ of speech.\" This indicates that the ability to speak is intricately linked to processes that occur before the individual's conscious memory begins, highlighting the deeper spiritual and developmental aspects involved in speech acquisition.",

Rudolf Steiner explains, \"The elaboration of the brain is undertaken because the brain is the instrument of thought... But the individual has to express in his thought what he is as an individual being, in accordance with his former earthly lives.\"",

In point of fact, if it were a question of his own cleverness, it is possible that he might not accomplish what he does without that cleverness during the first period of his life. Why is all this accomplished in those depths of the soul which lie outside consciousness? This happens because the human soul and entire being are, during the first years of earthly life, in much closer connection with the spiritual worlds of the higher hierarchies than is afterwards the case. A clairvoyant who has gone through sufficient spiritual development to be able to witness actual spiritual events, sees something exceedingly significant at the moment when the ego acquires consciousness, i.e., the earliest point to which the memory of later years goes back. Whereas what we call the child’s aura floats round it in its earliest years like a wonderful human and superhuman power, and, being really the higher part of the child, is everywhere continued on into the spiritual world, at the moment to which memory goes back, this aura sinks more into the inner being of the child. A human being is able to feel himself a continuous ego as far back as that point of time, because then that which was previously in close connection with the higher worlds, passed into his ego. Henceforward the consciousness is at every point brought into connection with the external world. This is not the case with a very young child, to whom things appear only as a surrounding world of dreams.\nMan works on himself by means of a wisdom which is not within him. That wisdom is mightier and more comprehensive than any conscious wisdom of later years. The higher wisdom becomes obscured in the human soul, which in exchange receives consciousness.",

The paragraph explains that during this period, the human soul is in closer connection with these spiritual worlds, and a clairvoyant observer would see the child's aura as a powerful and continuous presence extending into the spiritual realm. As the ego develops consciousness, this aura becomes more integrated into the inner being of the child.

This transition occurs at the moment when the ego acquires consciousness, which is the earliest point to which the memory of later years goes back. This shift marks a change where the individual starts to feel themselves as a continuous ego and their consciousness becomes more connected with the external world. Prior to this moment, a very young child perceives things as a surrounding world of dreams, indicating a less direct connection to the external reality. The text highlights that this shift in consciousness is related to the evolving relationship between the individual's inner being and the external world as they mature.",

This transition marks the point at which the child's ego becomes continuous, and their consciousness becomes more connected to the external world.

These contrasting influences result in the causes of sorrow, disease, and death in human existence. The paragraph states, \"The causes of sorrow, disease and even of death are to be sought in the fact that, besides the beings who are evolving man in a straight line forwards, there are also ruling the Luciferic and Ahrimanic spirits, who are continually crossing the line of straightforward, progressive development.\"",

If he were to retain in full force beyond early childhood that part of his being which is better than the rest, he would be unable to endure its influence, because his whole being is weakened by the opposite forces of Lucifer and Ahriman. Man’s organism in the physical world is so constituted that it is only when he is, so to speak, as soft and pliable as a child, that he can endure within him those direct forces of the spiritual world which operate within him during early childhood. He would be shattered, if during his later life there were still directly working in him those forces which underlie the faculty of equilibrium in space, and the formation of the larynx and the brain. Those forces are so tremendous that, if they were to go on working, our organism would pine away under the influence of their holiness. Man must only have recourse to such forces for the purpose of that kind of activity which brings him into conscious connection with the supersensible world.",

This superiority is attributed to the minimal influence of Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces during early childhood, with these negative forces primarily affecting what man creates through conscious life. The paragraph explains that if man were to maintain the superior part of his being beyond childhood, he would be unable to withstand its impact due to the weakening effect of opposing forces. The text highlights that man's physical constitution allows him to endure the direct forces of the spiritual world during early childhood when he is still soft and pliable. It emphasizes that if these powerful forces, responsible for functions like equilibrium in space and the development of the brain and larynx, were to continue working in later life, they would overwhelm and potentially harm the individual. Therefore, man should only engage with these forces to engage consciously with the spiritual realm, as prolonged exposure could be detrimental to his well-being.",

These forces are described as being of such magnitude that if they were to continue working in man beyond early childhood, it would be overwhelming for him. The paragraph states, \"Man’s organism in the physical world is so constituted that it is only when he is, so to speak, as soft and pliable as a child, that he can endure within him those direct forces of the spiritual world which operate within him during early childhood.\" This highlights that these forces are vital for the initial development of man but need to be consciously accessed later in life for specific purposes related to connecting with the supersensible world.",

Steiner emphasizes that as individuals progress through multiple lives, they contribute to the advancement of the human race. He parallels this individual evolution with the ongoing development of the Earth itself. Eventually, there will come a time when the Earth reaches the end of its evolutionary path. Just as the human body separates from the spirit at death, the Earth will also transition from its physical form. At this point, the souls of humanity will move on to a spiritual realm between death and rebirth. Steiner suggests that it should be humanity's ultimate goal to have evolved sufficiently by the time of earthly death to fully benefit from the experiences and lessons gained during life on Earth.",

When this has fallen away from a human being, the latter, if he has attained the aim of his life, must have advanced far enough to be able actually to give himself up, with his whole being, to the powers which at present are only active in man during childhood. Thus the object of evolution through successive earthly lives is gradually to make the whole individual, including therefore the conscious part, into an expression of the powers which are ruling in him under the influence of the spiritual world, though he does not know it, during the first years of his life. The thought which takes possession of the soul after such reflections as these, must fill it with humility, but also with a due consciousness of the dignity of man. The thought is this: man is not alone; there is something living within him which is constantly affording him proof that he can rise above himself to something which is already growing beyond him, and which will go on growing from one life to another. This thought can assume more and more definite form; and in that case it affords something supremely soothing and elevating, at the same time filling the soul with corresponding humility and modesty. What is it that man has within him in this way? Surely a higher, divine human being, by whom he is able to feel himself interpenetrated, saying to himself, “He is my guide within me.”",

It suggests that as the earth separates from a person, upon death, one must have progressed adequately to fully surrender to the spiritual powers that only manifest in childhood. The evolution through successive earthly lives aims to transform the entire individual, including the conscious aspect, into a vessel for the spiritual forces that govern unknowingly during early life. This realization is meant to instill humility and awareness of human dignity, emphasizing the presence of a divine being within each person, guiding them towards growth and enlightenment across lifetimes.",

Rudolf Steiner explains, \"At the end of that span of time a child becomes capable of linking its impressions of the outer world to the ideas of its ego... man, during the present middle period of the earth, is so organized that he can receive these forces for only three years.\"",

And now suppose that an ego could then be introduced into the three bodies which is working in connection with spiritual worlds, what would happen to a person thus treated? At the end of three years his body would necessarily be shattered. Something would occur, through cosmic karma, which would prevent the spirit-being which would be in connection with higher worlds, from living more than three years in that body.[1] Only at the end of all his earthly lives will man have that within him which will enable him to live more than three years with that spirit-being. But then, it is true, man will be able to say to himself, “Not I, but that Higher One within me, Who was always there, is now working in me.” Till that time comes, he is not able to say this. The most he can say is that he feels that higher being, but has not yet progressed far enough with his real, actual human ego, to be able to bring the other to full life within him.",

This concept suggests that as a person evolves spiritually through successive earthly lives, they gradually become more aligned with the higher spiritual forces that operate within them, particularly during early childhood. The text explains that man needs to reach a certain level of spiritual advancement to be able to fully embody and sustain the presence of this higher being within them. It is mentioned that at the end of all earthly lives, man will have evolved enough to live with this spirit-being for more than three years. This evolution towards being able to host and work in harmony with the higher being within is a crucial aspect of spiritual development and the ultimate goal of spiritual evolution. As the text states, \"The most he can say is that he feels that higher being, but has not yet progressed far enough with his real, actual human ego, to be able to bring the other to full life within him.\" This indicates that spiritual evolution involves a deepening connection and alignment with the higher spiritual forces present within the individual, leading to a profound transformation and realization of the higher self.",

The text explains that if a person's ordinary ego is removed and replaced with an ego working in connection with spiritual worlds, the individual would not be able to endure this state for more than three years. This is because the human organism in the physical world is structured in a way that it can only bear the direct forces of the spiritual world that operate within during early childhood. The text states, \"Man’s organism in the physical world is so constituted that it is only when he is, so to speak, as soft and pliable as a child, that he can endure within him those direct forces of the spiritual world which operate within him during early childhood.\" Therefore, the human ego, which develops over time, plays a crucial role in gradually allowing the higher being to fully manifest within the individual. Until the individual has progressed far enough with their real human ego, they are not able to fully bring the higher being to life within them. The text concludes that only at the end of all earthly lives will man have the capacity to live with the spirit-being for more than three years, at which point the individual can acknowledge, \"Not I, but that Higher One within me, Who was always there, is now working in me.\"",

The human organism which stood in the river Jordan at John’s baptism when the ego of Jesus of Nazareth left the three bodies, contained, after the baptism, in complete conscious development, that higher Self of humanity which usually works with cosmic wisdom on a child without its knowledge. At the same time, the necessity arose that this Self which was in connection with the higher spirit-world could only live for three years in the appropriate human organism. Events had then to take place which brought the earthly life of that being to a close. The outer events in the life of Christ Jesus are to be interpreted as absolutely conditioned by the inner causes just set forth, and present themselves as the outward expression of those causes.\nWe are now able to see the deeper connection existing between that which is man’s guide in life, which streams in upon our childhood like the dawn and is always working below the surface of our consciousness as the best part of us, and that which once upon a time entered the whole of human evolution and was able to dwell for three years in a human frame.",

The text also highlights the significance of preparing oneself to be in harmony with these guiding forces, indicating a path towards spiritual enlightenment and a deeper understanding of human imperfection and potential for perfection.\n\nFurthermore, the text discusses the historical event of John's baptism of Jesus of Nazareth, where it is suggested that a higher Self of humanity, which typically works with cosmic wisdom on a child unknowingly, was fully present in the human organism at that moment. This event is linked to the idea that this higher Self could only reside in a human body for three years, leading to the conclusion that specific events unfolded to bring an end to the earthly life of that being. This historical event is portrayed as a manifestation of inner causes and serves as a deeper connection between the spiritual guidance present in childhood and significant events in human evolution.\n\nIn summary, the text implies that human evolution and spiritual guidance involve the interaction of higher spiritual forces, the development of consciousness, and the potential for individuals to align themselves with these forces for spiritual growth and understanding.",

Furthermore, the text delves into the concept of spiritual evolution through successive earthly lives, suggesting that the ultimate goal is for individuals to align their conscious selves with the larger spirituality within them, akin to the state experienced during early childhood.

This challenges the idea of a straightforward evolutionary path for humanity, as these opposing forces impact human life, causing sorrow, disease, and death. The text emphasizes that man's higher potential, represented by the forces at work during early childhood, is hindered by the influence of Luciferic and Ahrimanic forces later in life.\n\nFurthermore, the text introduces the concept of a higher Self of humanity that typically works with cosmic wisdom on a child without their knowledge. This challenges conventional views by suggesting that there is a deeper, hidden aspect of human existence that influences individuals from within. The text also presents the historical fact of the human organism at John's baptism containing this higher Self, which could only live for three years in the appropriate human body, as seen in the case of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nOverall, the text challenges conventional notions by revealing the intricate interplay between higher spiritual beings, human evolution, and individual development, suggesting a more complex and spiritually guided understanding of human existence than commonly perceived.",

The question now arises, does this recognition lead to the further perception of the fact that this Christ once really dwelt on earth in a human body? Without bringing forward any documents, this question may be answered in the affirmative. For genuine clairvoyant knowledge of self leads the man of the present day to see that powers are to be discovered in the human soul which emanate from the Christ. These powers are at work during the first three years of childhood without any action being taken by the human being. In later life they may be called into action, if the Christ be sought within the soul by inner meditation. Man was not always able, as he is now, to find the Christ within himself. There were times when no inner meditation could lead him to the Christ. This again we learn from clairvoyant perception. In the interval between that past time when man could not find the Christ in himself, and the present time when he can find him, there took place Christ’s earthly life. And that life itself is the cause of man’s being able to find the Christ in himself in the manner that has been pointed out. Thus to clairvoyant perception the earthly life of Christ is proved without any historical records.",

It emphasizes that while in the past, man struggled to find the Christ within, Christ's earthly life facilitated this connection, enabling individuals to discover the Christ within themselves through inner meditation. The paragraph underscores that the existence of Christ's earthly life can be validated through clairvoyant insight, independent of historical records.",

From the spirit he learns to speak, i.e., to form truth; or in other words, he develops the essence of truth out of sound during the first three years of his life. And the life too, which man lives on earth as an ego-being, obtains its vital organ through what is formed in the first three years of childhood. Thus man learns to walk, i.e., to find “the way,” he learns to present “truth” through his physical organism, and he learns to bring “life” from the spirit into expression in his body. No more significant re-interpretation seems possible of the words “Except ye become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And momentous is that saying in which the ego-being of the Christ comes into expression thus, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.” Just as, unknown to a child, the higher spirit-forces are fashioning its organism to become the bodily expression of the way, the truth and the life, so the spirit of man, through being interpenetrated with the Christ, gradually becomes the conscious vehicle of the way, the truth and the life. He is thereby making himself, in the course of his earthly development, into that force which bears sway within him as a child, when he is not consciously its vehicle.\nThis saying about the way, the truth and the life is capable of opening the doors of eternity. It sounds to man out of the depths of his soul, if his self-knowledge is true and real.",

This concept is not limited to a historical figure but extends to every human being, emphasizing the presence of the divine within each individual.\n\nAs Rudolf Steiner explains, \"The Christ can be discerned in every human being\" and \"the Christ is living in man.\" This recognition leads to the understanding that the forces at work during childhood, which emanate from the Christ, are a reminder of the divine essence within each person. The words 'I am the way, the truth and the life' signify the potential for each individual to align themselves with these divine qualities and to strive towards embodying them in their earthly existence.\n\nTherefore, the suggestion of eternity in these words serves as a reminder of the profound connection between humanity and the divine, highlighting the continuous opportunity for spiritual growth and alignment with higher principles throughout each cycle of earthly life.",

It is better to give a description, and to try and call forth a feeling of what really exists. On this account we are now attempting to induce a feeling of what distinguishes the first three years of human life, and of the way in which this is related to the light that streams from the cross on Golgotha. The meaning of this feeling is that an impulse is passing through human evolution, and that through this impulse the Pauline saying, “Not I but the Christ in me,” will become a fact. We have only to know what man is in reality, in order to be able to proceed from such knowledge to insight into the nature of the Christ. When once, however, we have arrived at the Christ-idea through true observation of humanity, we know that we discover the Christ in the best way if we first look for Him in ourselves, and if we then return to the Bible records, these are for the first time rightly valued. And no one prizes the Bible more, or more consciously, than one who has found the Christ in this way. It is possible to imagine a being, let us say an inhabitant of Mars, descending to earth, without ever having heard of the Christ and His work. Much that has taken place on earth would be incomprehensible to the Martian; much that interests people nowadays would not interest him. But it would interest him to discover the central impulse of earthly evolution, i.e., the Christ-idea, as it is expressed in human nature itself.\nOne who has grasped this, is able for the first time rightly to understand the Bible, for he finds expressed there in a marvellous way what he has previously observed in himself, and he says: It is not necessary to have been brought up with any special reverence for the Gospel; they need only be presented to me, a fully-conscious human being, to stand revealed in all their greatness, by means of what I have learnt through occult science.",

By focusing on the unique qualities of the first three years of life, one can come to recognize the presence of a spiritual impulse that aligns with the Pauline saying, “Not I but the Christ in me.” This understanding leads to the realization that true insight into the nature of the Christ can be attained by looking within oneself first. Through this introspection, one can then approach the Bible records with a newfound appreciation and understanding, recognizing the profound connection between the Christ-idea and human nature. This process enables a person to grasp the central impulse of earthly evolution, the Christ-idea, and to interpret the Bible in a way that resonates with their personal experiences and spiritual insights. Ultimately, this approach allows for a deeper and more meaningful engagement with spiritual truths and the teachings of the Bible.",

It is only through knowledge of human nature itself that humanity will learn to see what is latent in those profound records. It will then be said: If there is to be found in the Gospels that which forms an integral part of human nature, it must have come from the people who wrote these documents on earth. Therefore what genuine reflection brings home to us about our own lives, the more so the older we grow must hold especially good with regard to those writers. We ourselves have done many things which we only understand years afterwards, and in the writers of the Gospels may be seen people who wrote out of the higher self which works in man during childhood, so that the Gospels are writings emanating from the wisdom which moulds human nature. Man through his body is a manifestation of spirit, and the Gospels are such a manifestation in writing.",

Just as higher forces are at work on the brain during the first three years of childhood, so there were higher forces from spiritual worlds impressed on the souls of the Evangelists, under the influence of which they wrote the Gospels. The spiritual guidance of humanity is expressed in such a fact as this. For the human race must surely be guided, if within it there are people working who write records under the influence of the same powers that are at work on the moulding of man in profound wisdom. And just as the individual says or does things which he only understands at a later period of life, so collective humanity has produced in the Evangelists means of revelation which can only be understood by degrees. The farther humanity progresses, the greater will be the understanding of these records. The individual can feel spiritual guidance within himself; and collective humanity can feel it in those of its members who work as did the writers of the Gospels.\nThe idea thus gained of the guidance of humanity may be extended in many directions. Let us suppose that a man finds disciples, a few people who follow him. Such an one will soon become aware, through genuine self-knowledge, that the very fact of his finding disciples gives him the feeling that what he has to say does not originate with himself. The case is rather this, that spiritual powers in higher worlds wish to communicate with the disciples, and find in the Teacher the fitting instrument for their manifestation.\nThe thought will suggest itself to such a man: when I was a child I worked on myself by the aid of forces proceeding from the spiritual world, and what I am now able to give, of my best, must also proceed from higher worlds; I may not look upon it as belonging to my ordinary consciousness. Such a man may in fact say: something demonic, something like a “daimon” using the word in the sense of a good spiritual power is working out of a spiritual world through me on my disciples.",

Drawing parallels between the higher forces shaping a child's brain in the first three years of life and the influence of spiritual realms on the souls of the Evangelists who wrote the Gospels, Steiner emphasizes the spiritual guidance inherent in such acts of creation. He posits that as individuals may say or do things that they comprehend only later in life, collective humanity, through figures like the Evangelists, produces revelations that require gradual understanding as humanity evolves. This understanding of spiritual guidance extends to scenarios where a teacher gathers disciples, leading to the realization that their teachings are channeled from higher spiritual realms through them. This insight prompts the recognition that the wisdom shared is not solely of personal origin but is a manifestation of divine influence, akin to a benevolent spiritual force working through them for the benefit of their disciples.",

Many attempts have been made to explain this “daimon” of Socrates, but it can only be explained by supposing that Socrates was able to feel something like that which results from the above reflections. Then we are able to understand that throughout the three or four centuries during which the Socratic principle was active in Greece, a state of feeling permeated the Greek world through Socrates, which prepared the way for another great event. The feeling that man, as he now is, is not the whole of what comes through from higher worlds, this feeling went on working. The best of those in whom it was present were those who afterwards best understood the words, “Not I, but the Christ in me.” For they could say to themselves: Socrates used to speak of a being working as a “daimon” from higher worlds; the Christ-ideal makes clear what Socrates meant. Only Socrates could not as yet speak of Christ, because in his time no one was able to find the Christ-nature within himself.",

            "text": "If we turn our attention to what was said by the teachers and leaders of ancient Egypt about the direction and guidance of the spiritual life of their country, we may trace a remarkable parallel between what is manifested in the individual life of man, and what governs human evolution as a whole. It is related that when a Greek once asked an Egyptian, who had guided and led his nation from ancient times onwards, he answered, “In far off times of yore, the gods ruled and taught us, and only afterwards men came to be our leaders.” The Egyptians named Menes to the Greeks, as their first leader on the physical plane to be recognized as a human leader. That is to say, the directors of the Egyptian people alleged that in earlier times the gods themselves as Greek records say guided and led the Egyptian nation. Such an assertion, coming down to us from ancient times, must, however, be rightly understood. What did the Egyptians mean when they said, “Our kings and great teachers were gods”?\n\nThe man who thus answered the question of the Greek meant that if any one had gone back into the ancient times of the Egyptian nation, and had asked those people who felt something within them like a higher consciousness, or wisdom from higher worlds, “Who are really your teachers?” they would have answered, “If I wanted to tell you about my real teacher, I should not point to such and such a person and say, ‘That is my teacher,’ but I should first have to put myself into a clairvoyant state, (it is known from occult science that this was comparatively easier in ancient times than it is now,) and then I should find my real inspirer and teacher, who comes to me only when the eyes of my spirit are opened.” For in ancient Egypt, beings who were not incarnated in a physical human body came down amongst men. In those remote ages, it was the gods who still ruled and taught the Egyptians, and by “gods” they understood beings who had preceded man in evolution.\n\nAccording to occult science, the earth passed through an earlier planetary condition, called the “Moon-state,” before it became “Earth.” During this condition man was not yet human in the present sense of the word; but there were on the old Moon other beings, not possessed of the present human form and differently constituted, who nevertheless were then at the evolutionary stage which man has now attained on earth. We may therefore say, that on the ancient Moon-planet which has perished, and out of which the earth afterwards originated, there lived beings who were man’s predecessors. In Christian esoteric language they are called Angel-beings (Angeloi) and the beings immediately above them Archangels (Archangeloi). The latter were human at a still earlier period than the angels. What are called angels or Angeloi in Christian esotericism, and Dhyanic beings in Eastern mysticism, were “men” during the Moon-period. Now these beings, during the present earth-period, are a stage farther advanced than man, those of them, that is to say, who completed their evolution on the Moon. Only at the end of the earth’s evolution will man have arrived at the stage which those beings had reached at the end of the Moon-period.\n\nWhen the earth-state of our planet began, and man appeared on earth, these beings were not able to appear in an external human form, for the human body of flesh and blood is essentially a product of earth, and is only adapted to the beings who are now human. The beings, who are a stage farther advanced than man, could not be incarnated in human bodies when the earth was beginning its evolution. They were only able to take a part in the government of the earth by illuminating and inspiring people in primeval times in the condition to which these attained when clairvoyant. Indirectly, then, through these clairvoyant people, the angels intervened to guide the destinies of earth.\nThus the ancient Egyptians still remembered a condition of things during which the leading personalities of the nation were clearly conscious of their connection with what are called gods, angels, or dhyanic beings. Now what sort of beings were these, who were not incarnated in a human form of flesh and blood, but influenced mankind in the way we have described? They were man’s predecessors, who had progressed beyond the human stage.\nThere is in these days much misuse of a word which may in this connection be applied in its true meaning, the word “Superman.” If we really wish to speak of “Supermen,” it is these beings who may rightly be so called, who were human during the Moon-period, the planetary stage preceding our earth and who have now outgrown humanity. They were only able to appear in an etheric body to clairvoyants. It was thus that they came down to earth from spiritual worlds, and ruled there even as late as post-Atlantean times.\n\nThese beings had, and still have, the remarkable quality of not being obliged to think; in fact, we might even say that they cannot think at all as man does. How then does man think? More or less in this way. He starts from a certain point and says, “I understand this or that,” and from that point he then tries to understand various other things. If this were not the method of human thought, school-life would not be such a difficult period for many. We cannot learn mathematics in a day, because we have to begin at a certain point, and go slowly forwards. This takes a long time. We cannot survey a whole world of thought at a glance, for human thought runs its course in time. A system of thought does not enter the mind in a flash. We have to make an effort, and have to exert ourselves, in order to find the sequence of thought. The beings described above are without this human peculiarity. A far-reaching train of thought comes into their minds with the same rapidity with which an animal makes up its mind that it will snatch at something which its instinct tells it is eatable. Instinct and reflective consciousness are in no wise distinct in these beings, they are one and the same thing. Just as animals have instinct at their stage of evolution, in their kingdom, so these dhyanic beings or angels have direct spiritual thought and conceptions. By virtue of this instinctive inner life of conception, they are of an essentially different nature from human beings.\n\nNow we can easily form an idea of the impossibility of the use by these beings of a brain or physical body such as we have. They have to use an etheric body, because the human body and brain only allow of thoughts in time, whereas these beings do not develop their thoughts in time, but feel the wisdom that is approaching them blaze forth, as it were, spontaneously within them. It is impossible for them to think erroneously in the sense in which man does. The process of their thought is a direct inspiration. Hence the personalities who were able to come into contact with these superhuman or angelic beings, were conscious that they were in the presence of unerring wisdom. Therefore, even as late as in ancient Egyptian times when the man who was the human teacher or king was in the presence of his spiritual guide, he felt thus: the command which he is giving, the truth which he is enunciating, is literally right, and cannot be wrong. (This was also felt by those to whom the truths were passed on.)\n\nThe clairvoyant guides of the human race were able to speak in such a manner that in their words people believed they were receiving exactly what came down from the spiritual world. In short, there was a direct current down from the higher spirit-hierarchies which were directing humanity. Thus what works on the individual in early childhood may be seen working on humanity at large in the form of the next world of spirit-hierarchies which hovers over human evolution as a whole. This is the next kingdom of the angels or superhuman beings, standing a step higher than man, and extending directly into spiritual spheres. They bring down to earth from those spheres what is worked into human civilization. In the child, it is on the formation of the body that the higher wisdom leaves its impress; in human evolution of past ages, it was civilization that was so matured.\nThus the Egyptians, who described themselves as being in connection with divinity, felt that the soul of humanity was open to the action of spirit hierarchies. Just as the soul of a child opens its aura to the hierarchies up to the time mentioned in the preceding pages, so, through its work, did the whole of humanity open its world to the hierarchies with which it was connected.\n\nThis connection was most important in those teachers whom we call the holy teachers of India, the great teachers of the first post-Atlantean or Indian civilization, which unfolded itself in Southern Asia. When the Atlantean catastrophe was over, and the physiognomy of the earth had changed, so that the new conformation of Asia, Europe and Africa had evolved in the Eastern hemisphere, the civilization led by the ancient great teachers of India began. This was before the time we have mentioned as reported in ancient records. The man of to-day is apt to get quite a wrong idea about these teachers. If, for example, one of the great Indian teachers were to be confronted with an educated man of the present day, the latter would gaze upon him with astonishment, and perhaps say, “Is that a great teacher? I should never have thought it.” For using the words “clever” or “learned” in the sense in which modern people of culture do, the holy teachers of ancient India had nothing clever to say. They were, in the present sense of the words, simple, homely people, who would have answered even questions of everyday life in the simplest fashion possible. And there were many periods during which scarcely anything could be elicited from them but what would seem, to an educated man of to-day, most insignificant. But on the other hand, there were certain times when these holy teachers were revealed as something more than simple, homely men. At these times they were obliged to be together to the number of seven, because what each individual was able to feel had to combine harmoniously with the other six teachers, as though in a consonance of seven sounds. For it was then possible for each one to see something according to his particular gift and degree of development, so that from the harmony of the separate parts which each individual was able to see, there arose what comes down to us from ancient times as primeval wisdom, that is supposing we know how to decipher the real occult records. These records are not the revelations of the Vedas, however much we may admire them. What the Indian holy teachers taught is of much earlier date than the composition of the Vedas, and it is only a feeble echo of their wisdom which lies before us in these mighty works. But when each of these men was in the presence of a superhuman predecessor of humanity, was gazing clairvoyantly into higher worlds and listening clairaudiently to what was being taught through that predecessor, it was as though the sun shone out of their eyes. What they were then able to say worked with overpowering force on their environment, so that all who heard them knew that it was not human life or wisdom that was speaking, but that gods, superhuman beings, were influencing human civilization.\n\nThe ancient civilizations had their rise in this sounding through to mankind of the knowledge of the gods. Only by degrees in post-Atlantean times was the door, so to speak, closed into the divine spiritual world which in the Atlantean period had still been wide open for the human soul. And in the various countries and nations it was felt that man was thrown ever more and more on his own resources. What is revealed in the case of a child appears in humanity at large in a different way. The divine spiritual world is first diffused into the unconscious soul of a child, and the soul works upon the formation of the body. Then comes the moment at which the child learns to feel itself an “ego” and this is the moment to which its memory goes back in later life. This is what makes it possible to say that the wisest of men may still learn something from the soul of a child. From this point, however, the individual is left to himself. The ego-consciousness comes into being, and everything combines to make it possible for him to remember his experiences.\n\nSo, too, in the life of nations there came a time when they began to feel themselves more shut off from the divine inspiration of their early forefathers. Just as the child becomes gradually shut off from the aura that floats about its head in its earliest years, so in the life of nations did the divine ancestors withdraw themselves more and more, and mankind was left to its own research and to its own knowledge. When history speaks in this manner, the fact of the guidance of humanity is realized. “Menes” was the Egyptian name of him who inaugurated the first “human” civilization, and it is at the same time hinted that man thereby became liable to error, for thenceforward he was left to look for guidance to the instrument of his brain. That man was liable to fall into error is symbolically indicated by the fixing of the date of the construction of the labyrinth at the time when humanity was abandoned by the gods; for the labyrinth is an image of the convolutions of the brain as the instrument of man’s own thoughts, windings in which the thinker is able to lose himself. The Orientals called man as a thinking being “Manas” and Manu stands for the first great thinker. The Greeks called the first organizer of the human principle of thought Minos, and with him is associated the myth of the labyrinth, because it was felt that, since his time, mankind had gradually passed from the direct guidance of the gods to a guidance in which the “ego” feels the influence of the higher spirit-world in a different way.\n\nBesides those predecessors of man, the true supermen, who had completed their humanity on the Moon and had become angels, there are, however, other beings who did not perfect their evolution on the Moon. The beings called dhyanic in Oriental mysticism and angelic in Christian esotericism, consummated their evolution on the ancient Moon, and when man began his earthly career were already a stage higher than he was. But there were other beings who had not finished their evolution on the ancient Moon, any more than the higher categories of Luciferic beings had finished theirs. When the earth-state of our planet began, man as we have described him was not the only being there. He felt also the inspiration of divinely-spiritual beings; otherwise, like a child, he would have been unable to progress. Accordingly, besides these childlike human beings, there must have been also present on the earth, acting through them, beings who had completed their evolution on the Moon. But between these and man there were yet other beings who had not finished their evolution on the Moon, beings of a higher order than man, because, even as early as the ancient Moon-period, they might have become angels or dhyanic beings. At that time, however, they had not come to full maturity. They were angels in a backward state, yet they far out-distanced man as regards everything which man called his own. Generally speaking, they are beings occupying the lowest grade in the ranks of Luciferic spirits. They hold a middle position between men and angels, and with them begins the kingdom of Luciferic spirits.\n\nNow it is extremely easy to get an erroneous idea about these spirits. We might ask why did the divine spirits, the vicegerents of good, allow them to fall short, and thereby admit the Luciferic principle into humanity? And it might further be objected on this ground, that surely the good gods turned everything to good. This question is obvious. And another misunderstanding which might arise, is expressed in the idea that these are “evil” spirits. Both ideas are merely misunderstandings: for these spirits are by no means purely “evil,” although the origin of evil in human nature is due to them, but they stand midway between man and superman. In a certain way they are more perfect than men. In all the qualities which human beings have to acquire for themselves, these spirits have attained a high standard, and they only differ from man’s predecessors described above in being able to incarnate in human bodies whilst man is being evolved on earth. This is because they did not consummate their humanity on the Moon.\n\nThe dhyanic or angelic beings proper, who are the great inspirers of humanity, and to whom the Egyptian referred as being still their teachers, did not appear in human bodies, but could only manifest themselves through human beings. On the other hand, the beings in a mid-position between men and angels were still able, in very early times, to incarnate in human bodies. Hence amongst the human race inhabiting the earth in the Lemurian and Atlantean periods, we find people whose innermost soul-nature was that of an angel in a backward state; i.e., in the ancient Lemurian and Atlantean periods, there were not only ordinary people going about the earth, who through their successive incarnations were to arrive at what corresponds to the ideal of humanity, but beings who only outwardly appeared like the others. They had to bear a human body, for the outward form of a human being in the flesh is dependent on earthly conditions. Especially in the more ancient times did it happen that beings belonging to the lowest category of Luciferic individualities were present amongst men. And so at the same time when the angel-beings were working on human civilization through man, Lucifer-beings were also incarnated and founding human civilizations in various places. And when in the old folk-legends it is related that in some place there lived a great man who was the founder of a civilization, we are not to understand that a Lucifer-being was incarnated who must necessarily have been the vehicle of evil, for, on the contrary, human civilization received countless blessings through those beings.\n\nNow it is known through occult science that in ancient times, particularly in the Atlantean period, there existed a kind of primitive human language, a manner of speech which was similar all over the earth, because “speech” in those days came much more out of the depths of the soul than it does now. This may be gathered from the following: In Atlantean times, people felt all outward impressions in such a way that if the soul wished to express anything outward by a sound, it was constrained to use a consonant. What therefore existed in space pressed for imitation in a consonant. The blowing of the wind, the murmur of the waves, the shelter given by a house were felt, and imitated by man in consonants. On the other hand, the sorrow or joy which was felt inwardly, or even what in another being might be feeling, was imitated in a vowel. From this we can see that the soul became one, in speech, with outer events or beings. The following instance is taken from the Akashic Records: A man drew near a hut, which was arched in the ancient fashion and gave shelter and protection to a family. He noticed this, and expressed the protective arch by a consonant; and by a vowel he expressed the fact, which he was able to feel, that within the hut the souls in bodies were comfortable. Thence arose the thought, “Shelter.” “There is a shelter for me, shelter for human bodies.” The thought was then poured forth in consonants and vowels, which could not be otherwise than they were, because they were a direct impression of experience and had but one meaning. This was the same all over the earth. It is no dream that there was once a primitive human root-language. And, in a certain sense, the initiates of all nations are still able to feel that language. Indeed there are in all languages certain similar sounds which are nothing else than the remains of that universal language.\n\nThis speech was prompted in human souls by the inspiration of the superhuman beings, man’s true predecessors, who had perfected their evolution on the Moon. From this it may be seen that if that evolution alone had taken place, the entire human race would practically have remained one great unity, and there would have been uniformity of speech and thought all over the earth. Individuality and diversity could not have been developed, nor at the same time could human freedom. In order that man might become individual, cleavages had to take place in humanity, and the difference of language in different parts of the world is due to the work of those teachers in whom a Luciferic spirit was incarnated. According as a particular angel-being, who had fallen short in his evolution, was incarnated in a particular race, was he able to instruct its people in a particular language. Thus the ability to speak a separate language is, in all races, traceable to the illuminating presence of these great beings, who were angels in a backward state and stood far above the people of their immediate environment. For instance, the beings described as the original heroes of the Greeks and other nations, and who worked in a human form, were those in whom an angel who had fallen short was incarnated. Therefore these beings must by no means be characterized as entirely “evil.” On the contrary, they brought to man that which predestined him to be a free human being all over the globe, and they differentiated what otherwise would have constituted a uniform whole everywhere on earth. This is not only true of languages but of many other departments of life. Individualization, differentiation, freedom, we may say, comes from the beings who fell short in their Moon-evolution. It is true that we might say that it was the purpose of the wise government of the cosmos to bring all beings in planetary evolution to their goal, but if this had been done in a direct way, certain things would not have been attained. Certain beings were therefore arrested in their development because they were to have a special mission in the progress of humanity. Since the beings who had fulfilled their mission on the Moon would only have been able to educate a uniform human race, beings who had fallen short on the Moon were set over against them, and it thereby became possible for these backward ones to turn into good what had been really a fault on their part.\nThis opens up the question, why do evil, wickedness, imperfection and disease exist in the world? This problem should be looked at from the point of view from which we have just considered the imperfect angel-beings. Everything which at any time exhibits imperfection or backwardness will nevertheless be turned into good in the course of evolution. It is of course unnecessary to mention that such a truth as this affords no justification for bad actions on man’s part.\n\nThus we already have an answer to the question, why does a wise Providence allow certain beings to lag behind and not reach their goal? This happens just because there will be good reason for it at the time following upon the formation of such a purpose. For it was when nations were not yet able to guide and govern themselves that the teachers of particular periods and individuals arose. And all the different race-teachers, Cadmus, Cheops, Pelops, Theseus, etc., are, in one aspect, angel-beings in the depths of their souls. From this it appears that in this respect also, humanity is really subject to direction and guidance.\n\nNow at every stage of evolution there are beings who lag behind and do not attain the possible goal. Let us then look once more at the ancient Egyptian civilization, which ran its course thousands of years ago in the Nile valley. Superhuman teachers were manifested to the Egyptians, who said that these teachers guided mankind like gods. At the same time, however, other beings were also at work, who had only half or partially attained the angelic stage. Now we must fully understand that in ancient Egypt man reached a definite stage of evolution, i.e., that the souls of people of the present day had attained a definite stage in the Egyptian period. But it is not only man who gains by letting himself be guided; the beings also who direct and guide him attain thereby something which furthers their evolution. For instance, an angel is something more after he has guided humanity for a while, than he was before that guidance began. His guiding work helps him to progress, and this is true not only of one who has completed his evolution as an angel, but also of one who has lagged behind. All beings are able continually to advance; everything is in a state of perpetual development; but at every stage beings are left behind. Thus, in accordance with what has just been said, there can be distinguished in the ancient Egyptian civilization the divine leaders or angels, the semi-divine leaders who did not quite attain the angelic stage, and the men. But certain beings in the ranks of the angels again lag behind, i.e., they do not bring all their powers into expression when guiding humanity, but remain behind as angels during the ancient Egyptian stage of civilization. Similarly some of the incomplete angels lag behind. Thus whilst men below were progressing, certain individuals of the beings above, the dhyanic spirits or angels, fell behind in their evolution. When the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization came to an end, and the Graeco-Roman period began, certain guiding spirits from the former period, who had fallen behind in their evolution, were present. But they could not use their powers, for other angels or half-angelic beings had replaced them, and that meant that their own evolution was at a standstill.\n\nHence there comes under our notice a category of beings who might have used their powers during the Egyptian period, but did not at that time use them fully. In the ensuing Graeco-Roman period they were not able to use them, because then they were replaced by other guiding spirits, and all the conditions of that time made their intervention impossible. But just as the beings who had not reached the angelic stage on the old Moon were afterwards allotted the task of once more actively interposing in human evolution during the earth-period, so also the beings who as guiding spirits in the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization had stopped short in their development, afterwards received the mission, as beings who had lagged behind, of again intervening in civilization. Thus we shall be able to watch a later period of civilization in which beings sent to be guides are certainly there to direct the normal progress of evolution, but in which, at the same time, other beings are intervening who were left behind at an earlier stage, and more particularly those who fell behind during the ancient Egyptian period. The civilization to which we are referring is our own. We live at a time when, side by side with the normal directors of humanity, others are interposing who were left behind in the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic period.\n\nNow we have to look upon the evolution of events and beings in such a way that occurrences in the physical world must be considered only as effects or manifestations, the true causes of which are to be sought in the spiritual world. On the one hand our civilization is in the main marked by an upward movement towards spirituality, and this tendency of certain people towards spirituality is the manifestation of the spiritual directors of our contemporary humanity, who have attained their own normal stage of development. In everything which tends to lead man up to the great spiritual wisdom-truths transmitted to us by theosophy, these normal guides of our evolution are manifested. But the beings out-distanced during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization are also affecting the tendencies of our age. They are manifested in much that is being thought and done at the present time, and will again be manifested in what lies in the near future. They are revealed in everything which gives a materialistic stamp to our civilization, and may often be seen even in aspirations after spiritual things. In our age we are virtually experiencing a revival of Egyptian civilization. The beings who are to be looked upon as the invisible directors of what takes place in the physical world, fall accordingly into two classes. The first includes those spiritual individualities who have passed through their own normal course of development up to the present time. Hence they were able to interpose in the guidance of our civilization, whilst the directors of the preceding Graeco-Roman period were gradually finishing their task of guiding civilization during the first thousand years of Christianity. The second class, who work simultaneously with the first class of beings, are spiritual individualities who did not complete their evolution during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. They were obliged to remain inactive during the ensuing Graeco-Roman period, but are now able to resume their activity because our present age has points of resemblance to the Egypto-Chaldæic period. It thus comes about that many things arise in contemporary humanity which look like a revival of ancient Egyptian forces, but there is also much which is like a materialistic resuscitation of forces which then worked spiritually. To illustrate this, we may point to an example of the way in which ancient Egyptian knowledge has been revived in our days.\n\nLet us think of Kepler. He was quite possessed by the feeling of the harmony of the cosmos, and this idea was expressed in his important mathematical laws of the mechanism of the heavens, the so-called laws of Kepler. These are outwardly very dry and abstruse, but in Kepler they were the outcome of an understanding of the harmony of the universe. We may read in Kepler’s writings that in order to discover what he did, he was obliged to go to the sacred Egyptian mysteries, purloin their temple-vessels, and by this means bring knowledge into the world, the importance of which to humanity would only be known in later times.\n\nThis utterance of Kepler’s is by no means an empty phrase, but contains a dim consciousness of a revival of what he had learned in the Egyptian period, during a former incarnation. We may certainly entertain the idea that Kepler assimilated the ancient Egyptian wisdom during one of his previous lives, and that it reappears in his soul in a new form, adapted to a later age. That a materialistic impulse should enter our civilization through the Egyptian spirit is quite intelligible, for Egyptian spirituality was wrapped in a vigorous materialism, which found expression, for instance, in their embalming the physical bodies of the dead. This meant that they attached value to the preservation of the physical body. This has come down to us from the Egyptian period in a different form, but in one corresponding to our time. The same forces which had not then run their course, affect our age, but in a different way. The temper of mind which embalmed dead bodies gave rise to that which idolizes the merely material. The Egyptian embalmed dead bodies and thereby preserved what he accounted valuable. He thought that the development of the soul after death was connected with the preservation of the physical, material body. The modern anatomist dissects what he sees, and thinks that in this way he understands the laws of the human organism. Thus in our modern science there are living the forces of the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic world, which then were progressive forces, but which now represent what has lagged behind, and which must be recognized for what they are, if a correct estimate is to be formed of the character of the present time. These forces will injure a man of the present day if he does not know their real significance. He will take no harm from them, but will turn them to good account, if he knows their effect and thereby brings himself into the right relation to them. They have their value, for without them we should not have the present great achievements in technique, industries, etc. They are forces belonging to Luciferic beings of the lowest stage, and the danger lies in the fact that if they are not recognized aright, the materialistic impulses of the present time are thought to be the only possible ones, and the other forces, which lead up to the spiritual world, are not seen. For this reason any clear diagnosis is certain to discern two currents of thought in the present age.\n\nNow if a wise Providence had not allowed certain beings in the Egypto-Chaldæic period to fall short in their evolution, our contemporary civilization would have been wanting in necessary weight. In that case only those forces would be operative which would bring man into the spiritual world by main force. People would be only too ready to yield themselves up to those forces, and would become dreamers. The only life they would wish to know about would be one which is being spiritualized as fast as possible, and their standard of action would be a view of life which showed a certain degree of contempt for what is physical and material. But the present epoch of civilization can only fulfill its mission if the forces of the material world are brought to the fullest perfection, and if thus by degrees their sphere too is won for spirituality. Just as the fairest things may become corrupters and tempters of mankind if pursued in a one-sided way, so if this one-sidedness took root, there would be great danger that all kinds of good efforts would come into manifestation as fanaticism. True though it is that humanity is helped forward by its noble impulses it is also true that wild and fanatical advocacy of the noblest impulses may bring about the worst of results as far as true evolution is concerned. Only when people strive after the highest modestly and sensibly, not out of wild fanaticism, can anything beneficial to the progress of humanity take place. In order that the work done on earth at the present day may have the necessary weight, and that material beings of the physical plane may be understood, the wisdom which directs the government of the world left those forces behind which would normally have completed their evolution during the Egyptian period; and it is they who are now directing man’s attention to physical life.\nIt is obvious from the foregoing that evolution takes place under the influence both of normally progressive beings and of those who lag behind. Clairvoyant vision is able to trace the co-operation of both classes of beings in the supersensible world, and hence is able to comprehend the spiritual events of which the physical facts surrounding humanity are the manifestations.\n\nWe observe that, in order to understand cosmic events, it is not enough to have spiritual eyes and ears opened to the spiritual world by some kind of exercise. This only means that we see what is there, that we are cognizant of spiritual beings and know that they are entities of the soul-world or spirit-sphere. But it is also necessary to recognize what kinds of beings they are. We may meet some being of the soul or spirit world, but we do not necessarily know whether it is progressing in its evolution, or whether it belongs to the category of powers that have lagged behind; whether therefore it is pushing evolution onwards, or hindering it. Those people who acquire clairvoyant faculties and do not at the same time gain complete understanding of the conditions of human evolution which we have described may know absolutely nothing of the nature of the beings whom they meet. Mere clairvoyance must be supplemented by clear judgment of what is seen in the supersensible world. There is urgent necessity for this especially in our own time, but it had not always to be so much considered. If we go back to very ancient civilizations, we find different conditions. If in the most ancient Egyptian times a person was clairvoyant, and was confronted with a being from the supersensible world, the latter had, as it were, written on his forehead who he was. The clairvoyant could not mistake him. Now, however, the possibility of misunderstanding is very great. Whereas humanity in early times still stood very near the kingdom of the spiritual hierarchies and could see what beings it was meeting, it is now very easy to be mistaken, and the only protection against being severely injured is the effort to gain ideas and conceptions like those indicated above.\n\nA person who is able to look into the spiritual world is called esoterically a “clairvoyant,” but merely to be clairvoyant is not enough, for such a man might be able to see well enough but not able to discriminate. He who has acquired the faculty of distinguishing one from another the beings and events of higher worlds, is called an “Initiate.” Initiation brings with it the possibility of distinguishing between different kinds of beings. Thus it is possible to be clairvoyant in the higher worlds without being an Initiate. In ancient times distinguishing between spirits was not specially important, for when the ancient occult schools had brought a pupil so far as clairvoyance, there was no great danger of error. Now, however, this danger exists to a high degree. Therefore in all esoteric training, care should be taken that initiation should be acquired in condition to clairvoyance. In proportion to the extent of his clairvoyance must a man become capable of distinguishing between the various kinds of supersensible beings and events.\n\nIn modern times the powers guiding humanity are faced by the special task of bringing about a balance between the two principles of clairvoyance and initiation. Leaders of spiritual training had necessarily to pay attention to this at the beginning of the modern era. Therefore the esoteric spiritual movement which is adapted to present conditions, always makes a point of maintaining the right proportion between clairvoyance and initiation. This became necessary at the time when mankind was passing through a crisis with regard to its higher knowledge. That time was the thirteenth century. About the year 1250 was the point of time when mankind felt itself most shut out from the spiritual world. A clairvoyant looking back upon that period sees the following: The most eminent minds of that time who were striving after some kind of higher knowledge, could only say to themselves, “What our reason, our intellect, our spiritual knowledge are able to find out is limited to the physical world around us. With all our human endeavor and power of perception, we cannot reach a spiritual world. We only know of it by accepting the information concerning it which our forefathers bequeathed us.” This was the time when direct view of the higher worlds was obscured. That this can be said of the era in which scholasticism flourished, is not without significance.\n\nAbout the year 1250 was the time when men were compelled to fix a boundary between what they were able to apprehend for themselves, and what they had to believe from the impression made upon them by the traditions which had been handed down. What they could find out for themselves then became limited to the physical world of sense. Afterwards, however, came the time when there was more and more possibility of again winning a view of the spiritual world. But the new clairvoyance was of a different kind from the old, which virtually became extinct just about the year 1250. In the new form of clairvoyance, western esotericism was obliged strictly to uphold the principle that initiation must be the guide of spiritual sight and hearing. This was the special task assigned to an esoteric current which then entered the stream of European civilization. As the year 1250 drew near there arose a new kind of guidance into the supersensible worlds.\nThis guidance was prepared by the spirits then standing behind outer historical events, who centuries before had provided for the kind of esoteric training which would be rendered necessary by the conditions prevailing in 1250. If the term “modern esotericism” be not misused, it may be applied to the spiritual work of those very highly evolved personalities. External history knows nothing of them, but what they did is apparent in every form of civilization which has developed since the thirteenth century.\n\nThe importance of the year 1250 for the spiritual evolution of humanity is specially apparent if we look at the result of clairvoyant research given in the following fact: Even those individualities who had attained high stages of spiritual development, in previous incarnations, and who were reincarnated about 1250, were compelled for a while to undergo a complete clouding over of their direct view of the spiritual world. Quite enlightened individuals were as though cut off from the spiritual world, and their only knowledge of it was through their remembrance of earlier incarnations. Thus we see how necessary it was that from that time onwards a new element should be brought into the spiritual guidance of humanity. This element was true modern esotericism. By its means it is for the first time possible rightly to understand how that which we call the “Christ-impulse” may intervene to guide the whole of mankind and the individual also, in all possible eventualities.\n\nBetween the accomplishment of the Mystery of Golgotha and the beginnings of modern esotericism, lies the first period of the working of the Christ-principle in human souls. During that period, people received Christ to a certain degree unconsciously as far as their higher spirit-forces were concerned, and this caused them afterwards, when they were obliged to receive them consciously, to make all kinds of mistakes, and to lose themselves in a maze instead of understanding Christ. In primitive Christian times we may trace the adoption of the Christ-principle by the lower soul-forces. Then came a new period, in which mankind of to-day is still living. Indeed, in a certain respect, people are only now beginning to understand the Christ principle with the higher faculties of their souls. In the further course of this work it will be shown that the decline of supersensible knowledge down to the thirteenth century, and on the other hand its slow revival since that time, coincide with the interposition of the Christ-impulse in human evolution.\nWe may therefore take modern esotericism to mean the raising of the Christ-impulse to be the motive power in the guidance of souls desiring to work their way to a knowledge of higher worlds, in accordance with the evolutionary conditions of modern times.",

                            "text": "In \"Lecture II\" of \"The Spiritual Guidance of Man and of Mankind\" by Rudolf Steiner, a profound exploration of the spiritual evolution of humanity and its guidance by higher beings is presented. Steiner begins by drawing parallels between the spiritual guidance of ancient civilizations, particularly Egypt, and the overarching spiritual evolution of mankind. He explains that ancient Egyptians believed their kings and great teachers were gods, or higher beings, who directly influenced and guided human affairs. These beings, according to Steiner's interpretation of occult science, evolved from a previous planetary condition known as the \"Moon-state,\" where they existed in forms different from contemporary human beings. These beings, referred to as angels or Dhyanic beings in various spiritual traditions, had advanced beyond the human stage by the time Earth's evolution began.\n\nSteiner delves into the nature of these higher beings, emphasizing their distinct mode of cognition, which does not involve human-like thinking but rather an instinctive, direct apprehension of spiritual truths. This form of cognition allowed them to guide humanity indirectly through inspiration, particularly in ancient times when human clairvoyant abilities were more common. The Egyptian civilization, among others, was deeply influenced by these beings, whom Steiner also associates with the concept of \"Supermen\" due to their advanced evolutionary state.\n\nThe text further explores the role of beings who did not complete their evolution during the Moon period, including Luciferic beings, in shaping human civilization. These beings, while more advanced than humans, contributed to the diversity of languages and cultures by imparting different spiritual influences across various human groups. This diversity, according to Steiner, was essential for the development of individuality and freedom among humans.\n\nSteiner also addresses the concept of beings who lag behind in their spiritual evolution, explaining that their continued influence is part of the divine cosmic plan, allowing for a balance between spiritual and material forces in human civilization. This balance is crucial for the evolution of both humanity and the spiritual beings themselves, as it enables the latter to progress in their own development.\n\nThe lecture touches on the revival of ancient Egyptian wisdom in modern times, exemplified by figures like Kepler, and the materialistic tendencies that have emerged from the influence of beings who did not complete their evolution. Steiner argues that recognizing and understanding these influences is vital for navigating the materialistic challenges of the contemporary world.\n\nSteiner concludes by emphasizing the importance of initiation and clairvoyance in discerning the nature and intentions of various spiritual beings encountered in esoteric practice. He highlights the necessity of a balanced development of these faculties, particularly in the modern era, to avoid misunderstandings and ensure a proper alignment with the spiritual guidance of humanity. The lecture ultimately frames the spiritual evolution of humanity as a complex interplay between various forces and beings, with the Christ impulse serving as a central guiding principle in modern esotericism and the ongoing spiritual development of mankind.",

This reflects a broader principle of human evolution where higher beings or spirits have played a significant role in guiding and teaching humanity. \"For in ancient Egypt, beings who were not incarnated in a physical human body came down amongst men.\"\n\n2. **Evolutionary Stages of Beings**: The text discusses the concept of different beings at various stages of evolution, such as the Angel-beings (Angeloi) and Archangels (Archangeloi), who were at a higher evolutionary stage than humans during the Earth's development. This reflects the broader principle that human evolution is part of a larger cosmic evolution involving various beings at different stages. \"During this condition man was not yet human in the present sense of the word; but there were on the old Moon other beings...who nevertheless were then at the evolutionary stage which man has now attained on earth.\"\n\n3. **Clairvoyance and Spiritual Guidance**: The ancient Egyptians' reliance on clairvoyant states to connect with their divine teachers mirrors the broader principle that spiritual guidance and evolution involve opening oneself to higher wisdom and realms beyond the physical. \"In those remote ages, it was the gods who still ruled and taught the Egyptians, and by 'gods' they understood beings who had preceded man in evolution.\"\n\n4. **The Role of Superhuman Beings**: The text introduces the concept of \"Supermen,\" beings who had evolved beyond humanity during the Moon-period and now guide humanity from a higher plane. This reflects a broader principle that human evolution is influenced by beings who have already completed their own cycles of evolution and now assist humanity from a spiritual perspective. \"If we really wish to speak of 'Supermen,' it is these beings who may rightly be so called, who were human during the Moon-period.\"\n\n5. **Material and Spiritual Evolution**: The leadership and teachings in ancient Egypt, as well as the involvement of higher beings in human affairs, illustrate the intertwined nature of material and spiritual evolution. Human evolution is not just a physical or material process but is deeply connected with spiritual development and guidance from higher realms.\n\nIn summary, the teachings and leadership in ancient Egypt, as outlined in the text, reflect broader principles governing human evolution by highlighting the role of higher beings in guiding humanity, the evolutionary stages of different beings, the importance of clairvoyance and spiritual guidance, the concept of superhuman beings assisting humanity, and the interconnectedness of material and spiritual evolution.",

This concept is elaborated when the text explains, \"For in ancient Egypt, beings who were not incarnated in a physical human body came down amongst men. In those remote ages, it was the gods who still ruled and taught the Egyptians, and by 'gods' they understood beings who had preceded man in evolution.\" This indicates that the guidance and teaching in ancient times were believed to come directly from spiritual or divine entities rather than from human sources.\n\nThis concept of guidance from higher beings is further detailed through the explanation of the evolution of the earth and its inhabitants. It is mentioned that \"According to occult science, the earth passed through an earlier planetary condition, called the 'Moon-state,' before it became 'Earth.'\" During this Moon-state, beings existed who were at a stage of evolution that humans have now attained on Earth. These beings, referred to as \"Angel-beings (Angeloi)\" and \"Archangels (Archangeloi)\" in Christian esoteric language, or \"Dhyanic beings\" in Eastern mysticism, were considered the predecessors of humanity. They had already evolved beyond the human stage by the time the Earth began its evolution, and thus, they were not able to incarnate in human bodies but could influence humanity in a clairvoyant state.\n\nThe text elaborates that these higher beings, having evolved beyond the human stage, had a different nature of thought and consciousness. They did not think as humans do but had an instinctive inner life of conception, which allowed them to impart unerring wisdom and guidance to the clairvoyant guides of the human race. This form of guidance from higher beings is described as a direct current from the higher spirit-hierarchies, which directed humanity and was perceived as divine or godly intervention in ancient times.\n\nIn summary, by stating their kings and great teachers were gods, the Egyptians implied that their guidance and teachings originated from higher, spiritually evolved beings rather than from ordinary human sources. This reflects a broader concept of divine or spiritual guidance in ancient times, where evolved beings from previous stages of planetary evolution directly influenced and led humanity through clairvoyant individuals.",

During this Moon-state, humanity as we understand it today did not exist. Instead, there were beings who did not possess the human form as it is now recognized and were constituted differently. These beings, however, were at an evolutionary stage comparable to what humans have achieved on Earth. Thus, it is stated that \"on the ancient Moon-planet which has perished, and out of which the earth afterwards originated, there lived beings who were man’s predecessors.\"\n\nIn Christian esoteric language, these beings from the Moon-state are referred to as Angel-beings (Angeloi) and the beings immediately above them as Archangels (Archangeloi). The text clarifies that the Archangels were human at an even earlier period than the angels. Specifically, what are termed as angels or Angeloi in Christian esotericism, and Dhyanic beings in Eastern mysticism, were considered \"men\" during the Moon-period. Consequently, these beings, having completed their evolution on the Moon, advanced to a stage beyond humanity during the Earth-period. They are described as beings \"who are a stage farther advanced than man,\" those who had successfully completed their evolution on the Moon.\n\nWhen the Earth-state began, and humans appeared on Earth, these advanced beings, the Angel-beings and Archangels, were not able to incarnate in human bodies of flesh and blood, as the human physical form is a product of Earth's evolution and uniquely adapted to beings currently undergoing human evolution. Instead, these advanced beings could only participate in Earth's governance by \"illuminating and inspiring people in primeval times in the condition to which these attained when clairvoyant.\" This indirect influence through clairvoyant individuals allowed the Angel-beings to guide the destinies of Earth and humanity.\n\nTherefore, the transition from the Moon-state to Earth, according to occult science, involved a significant evolutionary shift where the beings who had reached an advanced stage during the Moon-period (the Angel-beings and Archangels) transitioned to roles of guidance and inspiration for the nascent human beings on Earth. These advanced beings could not incarnate directly in physical human forms but influenced humanity's spiritual development through their etheric presence and interaction with clairvoyant individuals.",

This is evident from the narrative shared about the Egyptian response to a Greek's inquiry, where it was stated that in ancient times, \"the gods ruled and taught us, and only afterwards men came to be our leaders\" (paragraph 1). This perception aligns with the concept of 'Supermen' as described in the text, where 'Supermen' are essentially beings who had evolved beyond the human stage during the \"Moon-period,\" the planetary stage preceding our Earth. These beings, referred to as \"Angel-beings (Angeloi)\" and \"Archangels (Archangeloi)\" in Christian esoteric language, or \"Dhyanic beings\" in Eastern mysticism, were considered the real teachers and inspirers of ancient Egyptians (paragraphs 2-3).\n\nThe Egyptians' understanding that their kings and great teachers were once gods reflects their belief in the direct influence and rule of these higher beings in their civilization's formative stages. This belief is elaborated upon with the explanation that these beings, who were not incarnated in a physical human body, \"came down amongst men\" and were the entities that \"still ruled and taught the Egyptians\" during those ancient times (paragraph 2). This directly correlates with the concept of 'Supermen' who, having evolved beyond humanity during the Moon-period, were able to appear in an etheric body to clairvoyants and guide humanity from spiritual worlds (paragraphs 4-5).\n\nMoreover, the ancient Egyptians' perception of their divine connection and the concept of 'Supermen' both emphasize a higher form of wisdom and guidance that transcends human capabilities. The 'Supermen' or higher beings are described as possessing an instinctive inner life of conception and direct spiritual thought, which is fundamentally different from human beings who develop thoughts in time (paragraph 6). This superior form of existence and guidance is what the ancient Egyptians recognized and revered in their divine connections.\n\nIn summary, the ancient Egyptians perceived their connection with divine beings as a direct leadership from higher, evolved entities, which they initially identified as gods. This perception aligns with the concept of 'Supermen' in the text, as these 'Supermen' or higher beings were the predecessors of humanity who had reached an advanced stage of evolution and continued to guide and influence human civilization from a spiritual realm, embodying the higher wisdom and capabilities that the Egyptians revered.",

This is exemplified by the learning process, such as learning mathematics, which cannot be accomplished instantly but requires starting from a certain point and progressing slowly forward.\n\nIn contrast, the thought process of dhyanic beings or angels is likened to instinct, where \"A far-reaching train of thought comes into their minds with the same rapidity with which an animal makes up its mind that it will snatch at something which its instinct tells it is eatable.\" For these beings, \"Instinct and reflective consciousness are in no wise distinct... they are one and the same thing.\" This indicates that their thought and understanding are immediate and intuitive, without the linear progression and time-bound nature of human thought.\n\nThe implications of this difference for their interaction with humanity are profound. Since these beings do not develop their thoughts in time but instead experience wisdom spontaneously, they cannot use a human body or brain, which are adapted to thoughts in time. Their mode of interaction with humanity, therefore, is through inspiration rather than direct communication or incarnation in human form. They illuminate and inspire people in primeval times when in a clairvoyant state, indirectly guiding the destinies of earth through these clairvoyant individuals. Their thought process, being a direct inspiration, means that when they communicate with humans, the wisdom they impart is perceived as unerring. This is because their \"process of their thought is a direct inspiration,\" leading those who came into contact with them to feel in the presence of unerring wisdom. \n\nThus, the difference in thought processes between dhyanic beings or angels and humans necessitates a form of interaction that is based on inspiration and guidance from a higher, more intuitive and instantaneous understanding of the world, rather than direct physical intervention or verbal communication within the constraints of time and human thought processes.",

The text explains, \"The clairvoyant guides of the human race were able to speak in such a manner that in their words people believed they were receiving exactly what came down from the spiritual world.

The text states, \"Thus what works on the individual in early childhood may be seen working on humanity at large in the form of the next world of spirit-hierarchies which hovers over human evolution as a whole.\" This suggests that just as the soul of a child is receptive to the impressions and guidance from higher spiritual realms, influencing its development, humanity as a whole has also been receptive to the wisdom and guidance from higher spirit-hierarchies through the mediation of clairvoyant guides. Both scenarios depict a process where higher wisdom from spiritual realms influences development, whether it be the individual development of a child or the collective evolution of humanity.",

These teachers were described as simple, homely people who, under normal circumstances, would provide answers to questions of everyday life in the simplest fashion possible. Their teachings were not characterized by what modern culture would deem \"clever\" or \"learned\" but were rooted in a profound connection with higher spiritual realities. This simplicity and directness in their approach to teaching and living were key aspects of how they transmitted primeval wisdom.\n\nHowever, there were specific times when these teachers revealed themselves as more than mere simple, homely men. During these moments, they had to gather together to the number of seven, allowing each individual's unique perceptions to harmonize with the others, creating a consonance of seven sounds. This collective and harmonized insight enabled them to see and convey aspects of primeval wisdom. The wisdom that arose from this harmony of the separate parts each individual could see is what has come down from ancient times as primeval wisdom, assuming one knows how to decipher the real occult records. It is important to note that this wisdom is of much earlier date than the composition of the Vedas and that the Vedas themselves are only a feeble echo of the wisdom taught by these ancient teachers.\n\nThe distinction between the teachings of these great teachers and the Vedas lies in the origin and depth of the wisdom conveyed. The Vedas, while admired, are described as not containing the original teachings of the Indian holy teachers but rather a diluted version of their profound insights. The primeval wisdom taught by these teachers was a direct result of their clairvoyant interactions with higher worlds and their ability to listen clairaudiently to what was being taught through their superhuman predecessors. This direct transmission of wisdom from higher spiritual realms, combined with the unique method of collective insight among the teachers, set their teachings apart from the Vedas, which are seen as a later, less direct echo of the ancient wisdom.",

However, the presence and influence of Luciferic beings, who had not completed their evolution during the Moon period, led to the differentiation among humans:\n\n\"In order that man might become individual, cleavages had to take place in humanity, and the difference of language in different parts of the world is due to the work of those teachers in whom a Luciferic spirit was incarnated.

These beings are described as occupying a middle position between humans and angels, and their influence led to the creation of various languages and cultures, which contributed to the individualization of humanity:\n\n\"Individualization, differentiation, freedom, we may say, comes from the beings who fell short in their Moon-evolution.\"\n\nThe text emphasizes that this process was part of a wise cosmic plan, where the influence of beings who lagged in their evolution was necessary for the development of certain qualities in humanity:\n\n\"It is true that we might say that it was the purpose of the wise government of the cosmos to bring all beings in planetary evolution to their goal, but if this had been done in a direct way, certain things would not have been attained. Certain beings were therefore arrested in their development because they were to have a special mission in the progress of humanity.\"\n\nThus, the diversity of languages and cultures is significant in the text as it represents the outcome of the Luciferic beings' influence on human evolution, contributing to the development of individuality, differentiation, and freedom among humans.",

It explains that certain beings did not complete their evolution during previous cosmic cycles (such as the Moon phase) and thus entered the Earth phase with a different role. These beings, referred to as \"Luciferic\" beings or spirits, are described as more advanced than humans in many respects but did not achieve the full potential of their development in the previous cycle. Their presence on Earth, while introducing the potential for evil and imperfection, also plays a crucial role in the development of human individuality, freedom, and diversity.\n\nThe text states, \"Everything which at any time exhibits imperfection or backwardness will nevertheless be turned into good in the course of evolution,\" indicating that what may appear as negative or destructive in the short term serves a greater purpose in the grand scheme of human and cosmic evolution. This perspective is further elaborated by explaining that the Luciferic beings, by not completing their evolution, were able to contribute to the differentiation of humanity, including the development of various languages and cultures. This differentiation was essential for the development of individuality and freedom, which are key components of human evolution.\n\nMoreover, the text suggests that the wise governance of the cosmos intentionally allowed these beings to lag behind in their evolution because their role was necessary for the progression of humanity. It emphasizes that the interaction between progressing beings and those who lag behind is a fundamental aspect of evolution, stating, \"evolution takes place under the influence both of normally progressive beings and of those who lag behind.\"\n\nIn summary, the text reconciles the presence of imperfection, evil, and disease with the concept of beings lagging behind in their evolution by presenting these elements as integral to the complex process of cosmic and human development. It portrays these imperfections not as mistakes or failures but as necessary components of a divine plan that ultimately leads to greater good, individuality, and freedom for humanity.",

According to the text, these beings, who did not complete their evolution during the Egypto-Chaldæic period, were inactive during the subsequent Graeco-Roman period but have resumed their activity in the present age due to similarities between our time and the Egypto-Chaldæic period. This has led to a revival of certain aspects of ancient Egyptian civilization, albeit in forms adapted to the modern era.\n\nThe text explains that \"our civilization is in the main marked by an upward movement towards spirituality,\" but it is also influenced by the beings who did not complete their evolution in the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. These beings are manifested in \"everything which gives a materialistic stamp to our civilization,\" including materialistic impulses and even in aspirations towards spiritual things that bear a materialistic character. This dual influence creates two currents of thought in contemporary society, one leading towards spiritual wisdom and the other towards materialism.\n\nThe materialistic tendencies in modern society are linked to the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic world, where spirituality was intertwined with a strong materialism, such as the practice of embalming dead bodies. This ancient materialism has transformed into a modern form, influencing contemporary science and industry. The text mentions that without the influence of these beings, modern achievements in technology and industry might not have been possible, highlighting their contribution to the development of material aspects of civilization.\n\nFurthermore, the text suggests that the presence of these materialistic tendencies is necessary for the current epoch of civilization to fulfill its mission. It argues that without these forces, there would be a risk of society becoming overly focused on spiritual development to the detriment of understanding and mastering the material world. The materialistic impulses introduced by the beings who lagged behind are thus seen as providing a necessary counterbalance, ensuring that humanity does not neglect the physical and material aspects of life.\n\nIn summary, the beings who lagged behind in their evolution during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization contribute to shaping contemporary civilization by fostering materialistic tendencies. This influence is considered necessary to balance the spiritual aspirations of modern society, ensuring a comprehensive development that includes both spiritual and material dimensions.",

Specifically, it states, \"A person who is able to look into the spiritual world is called esoterically a 'clairvoyant,' but merely to be clairvoyant is not enough, for such a man might be able to see well enough but not able to discriminate.\" It further elaborates that an \"Initiate\" is someone who \"has acquired the faculty of distinguishing one from another the beings and events of higher worlds,\" indicating that initiation brings with it the capacity to discern between different kinds of beings, understanding which are progressing in their evolution and which have lagged behind.\n\nThe balance between these two principles is crucial in modern esoteric training for several reasons. Firstly, the text highlights the danger of misunderstanding in the spiritual world for those who are merely clairvoyant without being initiated. It explains that in ancient times, distinguishing between spirits was not as critical because beings in the spiritual world were more transparent about their nature. However, in modern times, \"the possibility of misunderstanding is very great,\" making it essential for clairvoyants to also be initiates to avoid being \"severely injured\" by their encounters in the spiritual realm.\n\nSecondly, the text emphasizes that modern esoteric training must maintain the right proportion between clairvoyance and initiation to address the specific challenges of contemporary spiritual development. It mentions that around the year 1250, humanity experienced a significant shift, marking a period when direct access to the spiritual world became obscured, necessitating a new approach to spiritual guidance. This new approach, described as \"modern esotericism,\" required a strict adherence to the principle that initiation must guide spiritual sight and hearing. This was to ensure that individuals could navigate the complexities of the spiritual world safely and effectively, recognizing the nature of the beings they encounter and the implications of their interactions with them.\n\nIn summary, the text distinguishes between clairvoyance as the ability to see into the spiritual world and initiation as the ability to discern and understand the nature of spiritual beings and events. The balance between these two principles is crucial in modern esoteric training to ensure safe and effective spiritual development, particularly in the context of the complexities and potential misunderstandings that can arise in the spiritual world.",

This period is characterized by a profound shift in the way individuals could access and understand the spiritual realms, necessitating a new approach to esoteric training and spiritual sight.\n\nAround the year 1250, humanity reached a point where \"direct view of the higher worlds was obscured,\" and individuals were compelled to acknowledge a boundary between what they could apprehend through their own efforts, which was limited to the physical world, and what they had to accept based on the traditions and spiritual knowledge passed down from their ancestors. This era is described as a time when people could only say to themselves, \"What our reason, our intellect, our spiritual knowledge are able to find out is limited to the physical world around us. With all our human endeavor and power of perception, we cannot reach a spiritual world. We only know of it by accepting the information concerning it which our forefathers bequeathed us.\"\n\nThis limitation marked a crisis in humanity's spiritual knowledge and necessitated the emergence of a new kind of esotericism that would be adapted to the conditions of the time. The new form of clairvoyance that began to develop after this period was distinct from the old form, which had virtually become extinct by the year 1250. The new esotericism emphasized that \"initiation must be the guide of spiritual sight and hearing,\" highlighting the importance of not just being able to see into the spiritual world (clairvoyance) but also being able to discern the nature and evolutionary status of the beings encountered there (initiation).\n\nThis transition was prepared by highly evolved spiritual personalities who, centuries before, anticipated the need for a type of esoteric training that would address the challenges posed by the conditions around the year 1250. This preparation led to the establishment of what is referred to as \"modern esotericism,\" which is characterized by a balanced approach between clairvoyance and initiation, ensuring that individuals not only have spiritual sight but also the wisdom to understand and navigate the spiritual world effectively.\n\nIn summary, the significance of the year 1250 for the spiritual evolution of humanity lies in its marking a critical juncture where direct access to the spiritual world was obscured, prompting a shift towards a new form of esotericism that balances clairvoyance with initiation. This transition was essential for adapting to the spiritual needs of humanity and guiding its evolution under the new conditions of the time.",

The text explains that \"About the year 1250 was the time when men were compelled to fix a boundary between what they were able to apprehend for themselves, and what they had to believe from the impression made upon them by the traditions which had been handed down.\" This signifies a moment in history when human understanding was limited to the physical world, and knowledge of the spiritual had to be taken on faith from ancestral teachings.\n\nHowever, the emergence of modern esotericism brought about a new form of spiritual guidance that was distinct from the past. It emphasized that \"initiation must be the guide of spiritual sight and hearing,\" indicating a more disciplined and discerning approach to spiritual experiences. This new form of esotericism was prepared by highly evolved spiritual beings to address the unique challenges of the time, ensuring that the path to spiritual knowledge was aligned with the evolving conditions of humanity.\n\nThe integration of the Christ-impulse within this framework implies a deepening and more conscious engagement with the Christ principle in the evolution of human understanding. The text states, \"By its means it is for the first time possible rightly to understand how that which we call the 'Christ-impulse' may intervene to guide the whole of mankind and the individual also, in all possible eventualities.\" This suggests that modern esotericism enables a more direct and conscious connection with the Christ-impulse, allowing individuals to actively work with this principle in their spiritual development.\n\nFurthermore, the text highlights a transition in how humanity relates to the Christ principle, moving from an unconscious reception of Christ in the soul's lower forces to a more conscious understanding and engagement with the higher faculties of the soul. This evolution in understanding signifies a critical phase in human spiritual development, where individuals are now beginning to grasp the significance of the Christ-impulse with greater clarity and depth, facilitated by the principles of modern esotericism.\n\nIn summary, modern esotericism integrates the Christ-impulse into the guidance of souls seeking knowledge of higher worlds by providing a structured and discerning approach to spiritual development that is attuned to the needs of contemporary humanity. This integration signifies an evolution in human understanding of the Christ principle, moving towards a more conscious and direct engagement with this transformative force in the journey of spiritual awakening and growth.",

According to the text, the Egyptians believed that in earlier times, the gods themselves guided and led their nation. This belief influenced their perception of leadership, as they considered their kings and great teachers to be gods. This concept of divine rulership shaped the hierarchy and authority within Egyptian society, with leaders being seen as divine figures who were connected to the spiritual realm. This belief system likely played a role in legitimizing the authority of the rulers and maintaining social order based on a perceived divine mandate.\n\nIn summary, the belief in divine guidance in ancient Egypt influenced the societal structure by intertwining spiritual and earthly leadership, where rulers were perceived as divine beings with a direct connection to the gods, shaping the governance and hierarchy of the society.",

The passage explains that the Egyptians believed that in ancient times, their true teachers were not physical beings but rather spiritual entities who imparted wisdom from higher realms. These spiritual guides were accessible to individuals who could enter a clairvoyant state, a practice more common in ancient times. The Egyptians considered these guides to be gods, beings who had evolved before humans and who continued to influence and teach them. This understanding sheds light on the profound spiritual connection and guidance that the Egyptians believed in, emphasizing the role of non-physical entities in shaping their knowledge and evolution.",

We may therefore say, that on the ancient Moon-planet which has perished, and out of which the earth afterwards originated, there lived beings who were man’s predecessors. In Christian esoteric language they are called Angel-beings (Angeloi) and the beings immediately above them Archangels (Archangeloi). The latter were human at a still earlier period than the angels. What are called angels or Angeloi in Christian esotericism, and Dhyanic beings in Eastern mysticism, were “men” during the Moon-period. Now these beings, during the present earth-period, are a stage farther advanced than man, those of them, that is to say, who completed their evolution on the Moon.

During this phase, beings existed on the old Moon that were not human in the current sense but were at a stage of evolution equivalent to present-day humans on Earth. These beings, referred to as Angel-beings and Archangels in Christian esoteric terms, were predecessors to humans and were at a more advanced evolutionary stage during the Moon-period. The text highlights that these beings, now beyond human evolution, will only be reached by humans at the conclusion of Earth's evolution. Steiner delves into the intricate relationship between these celestial beings and the evolution of humanity, drawing parallels between different stages of planetary existence and the advancement of beings beyond the human realm.",

The beings, who are a stage farther advanced than man, could not be incarnated in human bodies when the earth was beginning its evolution. They were only able to take a part in the government of the earth by illuminating and inspiring people in primeval times in the condition to which these attained when clairvoyant. Indirectly, then, through these clairvoyant people, the angels intervened to guide the destinies of earth.\nThus the ancient Egyptians still remembered a condition of things during which the leading personalities of the nation were clearly conscious of their connection with what are called gods, angels, or dhyanic beings. Now what sort of beings were these, who were not incarnated in a human form of flesh and blood, but influenced mankind in the way we have described? They were man’s predecessors, who had progressed beyond the human stage.\nThere is in these days much misuse of a word which may in this connection be applied in its true meaning, the word “Superman.” If we really wish to speak of “Supermen,” it is these beings who may rightly be so called, who were human during the Moon-period, the planetary stage preceding our earth and who have now outgrown humanity. They were only able to appear in an etheric body to clairvoyants. It was thus that they came down to earth from spiritual worlds, and ruled there even as late as post-Atlantean times.",

The ancient Egyptians recognized and remembered this connection with these higher beings, who were the predecessors of humanity and had evolved beyond the human stage.

Therefore, these advanced beings played a role in guiding the destinies of the earth by illuminating and inspiring people in primeval times through clairvoyant individuals. The text states, \"Indirectly, then, through these clairvoyant people, the angels intervened to guide the destinies of earth.\" This highlights a spiritual hierarchy where beings beyond the human stage were involved in the governance of the earth, showcasing a deeper connection between humanity and higher spiritual entities throughout different stages of evolution.",

We cannot learn mathematics in a day, because we have to begin at a certain point, and go slowly forwards. This takes a long time.

They have to use an etheric body, because the human body and brain only allow of thoughts in time, whereas these beings do not develop their thoughts in time, but feel the wisdom that is approaching them blaze forth, as it were, spontaneously within them. It is impossible for them to think erroneously in the sense in which man does. The process of their thought is a direct inspiration. Hence the personalities who were able to come into contact with these superhuman or angelic beings, were conscious that they were in the presence of unerring wisdom. Therefore, even as late as in ancient Egyptian times when the man who was the human teacher or king was in the presence of his spiritual guide, he felt thus: the command which he is giving, the truth which he is enunciating, is literally right, and cannot be wrong.

Due to their different nature, they require an etheric body to interact with the physical world.

When the Atlantean catastrophe was over, and the physiognomy of the earth had changed, so that the new conformation of Asia, Europe and Africa had evolved in the Eastern hemisphere, the civilization led by the ancient great teachers of India began. This was before the time we have mentioned as reported in ancient records. The man of to-day is apt to get quite a wrong idea about these teachers. If, for example, one of the great Indian teachers were to be confronted with an educated man of the present day, the latter would gaze upon him with astonishment, and perhaps say, “Is that a great teacher? I should never have thought it.” For using the words “clever” or “learned” in the sense in which modern people of culture do, the holy teachers of ancient India had nothing clever to say. They were, in the present sense of the words, simple, homely people, who would have answered even questions of everyday life in the simplest fashion possible. And there were many periods during which scarcely anything could be elicited from them but what would seem, to an educated man of to-day, most insignificant. But on the other hand, there were certain times when these holy teachers were revealed as something more than simple, homely men. At these times they were obliged to be together to the number of seven, because what each individual was able to feel had to combine harmoniously with the other six teachers, as though in a consonance of seven sounds. For it was then possible for each one to see something according to his particular gift and degree of development, so that from the harmony of the separate parts which each individual was able to see, there arose what comes down to us from ancient times as primeval wisdom, that is supposing we know how to decipher the real occult records. These records are not the revelations of the Vedas, however much we may admire them. What the Indian holy teachers taught is of much earlier date than the composition of the Vedas, and it is only a feeble echo of their wisdom which lies before us in these mighty works. But when each of these men was in the presence of a superhuman predecessor of humanity, was gazing clairvoyantly into higher worlds and listening clairaudiently to what was being taught through that predecessor, it was as though the sun shone out of their eyes. What they were then able to say worked with overpowering force on their environment, so that all who heard them knew that it was not human life or wisdom that was speaking, but that gods, superhuman beings, were influencing human civilization.",

Only by degrees in post-Atlantean times was the door, so to speak, closed into the divine spiritual world which in the Atlantean period had still been wide open for the human soul. And in the various countries and nations it was felt that man was thrown ever more and more on his own resources. What is revealed in the case of a child appears in humanity at large in a different way. The divine spiritual world is first diffused into the unconscious soul of a child, and the soul works upon the formation of the body. Then comes the moment at which the child learns to feel itself an “ego” and this is the moment to which its memory goes back in later life. This is what makes it possible to say that the wisest of men may still learn something from the soul of a child. From this point, however, the individual is left to himself. The ego-consciousness comes into being, and everything combines to make it possible for him to remember his experiences.",

It highlights how in post-Atlantean times, the connection to the divine spiritual world gradually diminished, leaving humanity to rely on its own capabilities. The text draws a parallel between the development of a child's soul and the evolution of humanity, emphasizing how the divine spiritual world influences a child's unconscious soul before the emergence of ego-consciousness. It concludes by noting that once an individual reaches ego-consciousness, they are left to navigate their experiences independently. The paragraph underscores the significance of this transition and the impact it has on the development and self-reliance of both individuals and humanity as a whole.",

In ancient civilizations, such as in ancient Egypt, the divine spiritual world was more directly accessible to humanity.

The text states, \"Thus the ancient Egyptians still remembered a condition of things during which the leading personalities of the nation were clearly conscious of their connection with what are called gods, angels, or dhyanic beings.\" This direct connection with higher spiritual beings shaped the development and guidance of ancient civilizations.\n\nHowever, in post-Atlantean times, the relationship between man and the divine spiritual world changed. The text mentions that gradually, the door to the divine spiritual world became closed, and humanity felt increasingly reliant on its own resources. It states, \"And in the various countries and nations it was felt that man was thrown ever more and more on his own resources.\" This shift indicates that in post-Atlantean times, the direct influence and guidance from higher spiritual beings diminished, and humanity had to rely more on its own capabilities and consciousness.\n\nTherefore, the difference lies in the direct interaction and guidance from the divine spiritual world that characterized ancient civilizations, contrasting with the increasing self-reliance and independence of humanity in post-Atlantean times.",

Just as the child becomes gradually shut off from the aura that floats about its head in its earliest years, so in the life of nations did the divine ancestors withdraw themselves more and more, and mankind was left to its own research and to its own knowledge. When history speaks in this manner, the fact of the guidance of humanity is realized. “Menes” was the Egyptian name of him who inaugurated the first “human” civilization, and it is at the same time hinted that man thereby became liable to error, for thenceforward he was left to look for guidance to the instrument of his brain. That man was liable to fall into error is symbolically indicated by the fixing of the date of the construction of the labyrinth at the time when humanity was abandoned by the gods; for the labyrinth is an image of the convolutions of the brain as the instrument of man’s own thoughts, windings in which the thinker is able to lose himself. The Orientals called man as a thinking being “Manas” and Manu stands for the first great thinker. The Greeks called the first organizer of the human principle of thought Minos, and with him is associated the myth of the labyrinth, because it was felt that, since his time, mankind had gradually passed from the direct guidance of the gods to a guidance in which the “ego” feels the influence of the higher spirit-world in a different way.",

At that time, however, they had not come to full maturity. They were angels in a backward state, yet they far out-distanced man as regards everything which man called his own. Generally speaking, they are beings occupying the lowest grade in the ranks of Luciferic spirits.

They are described as beings who had not yet reached full maturity but were more advanced than humans. Rudolf Steiner explains that these beings, although in a backward state, possess qualities that surpass those of humans, indicating their potential positive impact on humanity's spiritual growth. He states, \"They were angels in a backward state, yet they far out-distanced man as regards everything which man called his own.\" This suggests that even though these beings were not fully evolved, they still possessed attributes that could benefit and guide humanity. Therefore, by interacting with and influencing human development, these beings contribute to the overall spiritual evolution of mankind.",

We might ask why did the divine spirits, the vicegerents of good, allow them to fall short, and thereby admit the Luciferic principle into humanity? And it might further be objected on this ground, that surely the good gods turned everything to good. This question is obvious. And another misunderstanding which might arise, is expressed in the idea that these are “evil” spirits. Both ideas are merely misunderstandings: for these spirits are by no means purely “evil,” although the origin of evil in human nature is due to them, but they stand midway between man and superman. In a certain way they are more perfect than men. In all the qualities which human beings have to acquire for themselves, these spirits have attained a high standard, and they only differ from man’s predecessors described above in being able to incarnate in human bodies whilst man is being evolved on earth. This is because they did not consummate their humanity on the Moon.",

These spirits, who did not complete their evolution on the Moon, are more advanced than humans in many aspects and are responsible for the origin of evil in human nature. Despite this, they are not inherently evil. They possess qualities that humans strive to attain and have the ability to incarnate in human bodies during human evolution on Earth due to their unfinished evolution on the Moon. This text challenges the common misperceptions about these spirits and sheds light on their complex nature and role in the spiritual hierarchy.",

On the other hand, the beings in a mid-position between men and angels were still able, in very early times, to incarnate in human bodies. Hence amongst the human race inhabiting the earth in the Lemurian and Atlantean periods, we find people whose innermost soul-nature was that of an angel in a backward state; i.e., in the ancient Lemurian and Atlantean periods, there were not only ordinary people going about the earth, who through their successive incarnations were to arrive at what corresponds to the ideal of humanity, but beings who only outwardly appeared like the others. They had to bear a human body, for the outward form of a human being in the flesh is dependent on earthly conditions. Especially in the more ancient times did it happen that beings belonging to the lowest category of Luciferic individualities were present amongst men. And so at the same time when the angel-beings were working on human civilization through man, Lucifer-beings were also incarnated and founding human civilizations in various places. And when in the old folk-legends it is related that in some place there lived a great man who was the founder of a civilization, we are not to understand that a Lucifer-being was incarnated who must necessarily have been the vehicle of evil, for, on the contrary, human civilization received countless blessings through those beings.",

This may be gathered from the following: In Atlantean times, people felt all outward impressions in such a way that if the soul wished to express anything outward by a sound, it was constrained to use a consonant. What therefore existed in space pressed for imitation in a consonant. The blowing of the wind, the murmur of the waves, the shelter given by a house were felt, and imitated by man in consonants. On the other hand, the sorrow or joy which was felt inwardly, or even what in another being might be feeling, was imitated in a vowel. From this we can see that the soul became one, in speech, with outer events or beings. The following instance is taken from the Akashic Records: A man drew near a hut, which was arched in the ancient fashion and gave shelter and protection to a family. He noticed this, and expressed the protective arch by a consonant; and by a vowel he expressed the fact, which he was able to feel, that within the hut the souls in bodies were comfortable. Thence arose the thought, “Shelter.” “There is a shelter for me, shelter for human bodies.” The thought was then poured forth in consonants and vowels, which could not be otherwise than they were, because they were a direct impression of experience and had but one meaning. This was the same all over the earth. It is no dream that there was once a primitive human root-language. And, in a certain sense, the initiates of all nations are still able to feel that language. Indeed there are in all languages certain similar sounds which are nothing else than the remains of that universal language.",

He explains that in those times, speech originated from the depths of the soul and was more connected to outer impressions. People expressed outward phenomena with consonants, such as imitating the wind or waves, while inner emotions or feelings towards others were represented by vowels. Through an example from the Akashic Records, where a man observed a sheltering hut and expressed it through consonants and vowels, Steiner illustrates how speech was intimately linked to experiences and events. He suggests that this primitive language was universal and that remnants of it can still be found in modern languages. Steiner highlights the deep connection between speech and soulful experiences in ancient times, emphasizing the unity between the soul and external events in the formation of language.",

This primitive human language, which was similar all over the earth during the Atlantean period, reflects a deep connection between speech and the soul's perception of the external world. In this language, consonants were used to imitate outward impressions, such as the blowing of the wind or the shelter of a house, while vowels were used to express inward feelings like sorrow or joy. This intimate connection between speech and experience meant that language was a direct reflection of one's soul experiences and perceptions of the world.\n\nThis universal root-language suggests a profound unity in human communication and a close relationship between language and the environment. It indicates a time when human speech was more attuned to the soul's connection with the external world, expressing not just words but also the essence of experiences and emotions. The fact that remnants of this universal language can still be found in modern languages implies a continuity in human communication that reaches back to these ancient times.\n\nOverall, the existence of a universal root-language highlights the deep spiritual and intuitive nature of human communication in the past and raises questions about how this ancient form of language influenced the development of diverse languages and communication systems over time.",

In the provided text, it is explained that in ancient times, particularly in the Atlantean period, there existed a primitive human language that was similar all over the earth. This language was deeply connected to the soul and nature, with consonants imitating outer events and beings, while vowels imitated inner feelings. This primal language was a direct impression of experiences and had a single, universal meaning.\n\nThis significance is highlighted in the text through the example of how sounds were used to express concepts like \"shelter\" based on direct experiences. The text states, \"The blowing of the wind, the murmur of the waves, the shelter given by a house were felt, and imitated by man in consonants... Thence arose the thought, 'Shelter.'\" This primal language was a direct reflection of human experiences and the connection between the soul and the outer world.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions that remnants of this universal language can still be found in modern languages. It states, \"Indeed there are in all languages certain similar sounds which are nothing else than the remains of that universal language.\" This implies that by studying and understanding these shared sounds across different languages, linguists can gain insights into the ancient roots of human language and culture.\n\nTherefore, the preservation of certain sounds from the universal root-language is crucial for linguistic studies as it provides a window into the ancient ways in which humans communicated and expressed their experiences. It also contributes to cultural heritage by connecting modern languages to their ancient origins, highlighting the shared linguistic and cultural heritage of humanity across different regions and civilizations.",

From this it may be seen that if that evolution alone had taken place, the entire human race would practically have remained one great unity, and there would have been uniformity of speech and thought all over the earth. Individuality and diversity could not have been developed, nor at the same time could human freedom. In order that man might become individual, cleavages had to take place in humanity, and the difference of language in different parts of the world is due to the work of those teachers in whom a Luciferic spirit was incarnated. According as a particular angel-being, who had fallen short in his evolution, was incarnated in a particular race, was he able to instruct its people in a particular language. Thus the ability to speak a separate language is, in all races, traceable to the illuminating presence of these great beings, who were angels in a backward state and stood far above the people of their immediate environment. For instance, the beings described as the original heroes of the Greeks and other nations, and who worked in a human form, were those in whom an angel who had fallen short was incarnated. Therefore these beings must by no means be characterized as entirely “evil.” On the contrary, they brought to man that which predestined him to be a free human being all over the globe, and they differentiated what otherwise would have constituted a uniform whole everywhere on earth. This is not only true of languages but of many other departments of life. Individualization, differentiation, freedom, we may say, comes from the beings who fell short in their Moon-evolution. It is true that we might say that it was the purpose of the wise government of the cosmos to bring all beings in planetary evolution to their goal, but if this had been done in a direct way, certain things would not have been attained. Certain beings were therefore arrested in their development because they were to have a special mission in the progress of humanity. Since the beings who had fulfilled their mission on the Moon would only have been able to educate a uniform human race, beings who had fallen short on the Moon were set over against them, and it thereby became possible for these backward ones to turn into good what had been really a fault on their part.\nThis opens up the question, why do evil, wickedness, imperfection and disease exist in the world? This problem should be looked at from the point of view from which we have just considered the imperfect angel-beings. Everything which at any time exhibits imperfection or backwardness will nevertheless be turned into good in the course of evolution. It is of course unnecessary to mention that such a truth as this affords no justification for bad actions on man’s part.",

The speech and individuality of humans were influenced by superhuman beings who had completed their evolution on the Moon. If only this evolution had occurred, humanity would have remained unified with uniform speech and thought. However, for individuality and freedom to develop, cleavages were necessary, leading to differences in language across the world. These differences were attributed to the work of angelic beings in a backward state, who incarnated in various races and instructed them in different languages. These beings, often associated with the original heroes of different cultures, were not inherently evil but played a crucial role in shaping human diversity and individuality. Despite the presence of imperfection and backwardness in the world, these elements are believed to ultimately contribute to the greater good in the course of evolution.",

Let us then look once more at the ancient Egyptian civilization, which ran its course thousands of years ago in the Nile valley. Superhuman teachers were manifested to the Egyptians, who said that these teachers guided mankind like gods. At the same time, however, other beings were also at work, who had only half or partially attained the angelic stage. Now we must fully understand that in ancient Egypt man reached a definite stage of evolution, i.e., that the souls of people of the present day had attained a definite stage in the Egyptian period. But it is not only man who gains by letting himself be guided; the beings also who direct and guide him attain thereby something which furthers their evolution. For instance, an angel is something more after he has guided humanity for a while, than he was before that guidance began. His guiding work helps him to progress, and this is true not only of one who has completed his evolution as an angel, but also of one who has lagged behind. All beings are able continually to advance; everything is in a state of perpetual development; but at every stage beings are left behind. Thus, in accordance with what has just been said, there can be distinguished in the ancient Egyptian civilization the divine leaders or angels, the semi-divine leaders who did not quite attain the angelic stage, and the men. But certain beings in the ranks of the angels again lag behind, i.e., they do not bring all their powers into expression when guiding humanity, but remain behind as angels during the ancient Egyptian stage of civilization. Similarly some of the incomplete angels lag behind. Thus whilst men below were progressing, certain individuals of the beings above, the dhyanic spirits or angels, fell behind in their evolution. When the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization came to an end, and the Graeco-Roman period began, certain guiding spirits from the former period, who had fallen behind in their evolution, were present. But they could not use their powers, for other angels or half-angelic beings had replaced them, and that meant that their own evolution was at a standstill.",

The discussion centers on ancient Egyptian civilization, where superhuman teachers guided humanity, with some beings only partially reaching the angelic stage. It emphasizes that both humans and guiding beings benefit from this interaction, as guiding humanity aids the beings in their own progression. The text highlights that beings, even those who have lagged behind in their evolution, can advance through guiding humans. It distinguishes between divine leaders, semi-divine beings, and humans in the Egyptian civilization, noting that some beings, including incomplete angels, fell behind during this period. As the Egypto-Chaldaic era transitioned to the Graeco-Roman period, certain guiding spirits who had lagged behind were replaced by other beings, leading to a standstill in their evolution.",

The text states that these teachers were manifested to the Egyptians and were perceived as guiding mankind like gods.

The guidance provided by these superhuman teachers not only benefited humanity but also contributed to their own evolution. The text explains that the work of guiding humanity helped these beings, whether they had completed their evolution as angels or had lagged behind, to progress and advance in their own development. Additionally, it is noted that when certain guiding spirits from the ancient Egyptian period, who had fallen behind in their evolution, were present during the transition to the Graeco-Roman period, they could not use their powers effectively as other angels or half-angelic beings had replaced them, leading to a standstill in their own evolution.",

These beings, whether fully evolved angels or those who lagged behind, played a role in guiding humanity and in turn, furthered their own evolution through this interaction.\n\nThe paragraph highlights that the guidance provided by these beings not only benefitted humanity but also contributed to the progress of the guiding beings themselves. It states, \"His guiding work helps him to progress, and this is true not only of one who has completed his evolution as an angel, but also of one who has lagged behind.\" This dynamic demonstrates a reciprocal relationship between beings of different evolutionary stages and humanity, where guidance and interaction lead to mutual advancement.\n\nFurthermore, the text explains how certain beings, including both fully evolved angels and those who had not completed their evolution, could fall behind in their development during specific stages of civilization. This concept is elucidated by mentioning that during the transition from the Egypto-Chaldaic civilization to the Graeco-Roman period, some guiding spirits from the former period who had lagged behind in their evolution were replaced by other beings, leading to a standstill in their own evolution.\n\nTherefore, the concept of beings lagging behind in their evolution provides insight into how spiritual hierarchies interacted with ancient civilizations, influencing their progress and development while also impacting the evolution of the guiding beings themselves.",

In the ensuing Graeco-Roman period they were not able to use them, because then they were replaced by other guiding spirits, and all the conditions of that time made their intervention impossible. But just as the beings who had not reached the angelic stage on the old Moon were afterwards allotted the task of once more actively interposing in human evolution during the earth-period, so also the beings who as guiding spirits in the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization had stopped short in their development, afterwards received the mission, as beings who had lagged behind, of again intervening in civilization. Thus we shall be able to watch a later period of civilization in which beings sent to be guides are certainly there to direct the normal progress of evolution, but in which, at the same time, other beings are intervening who were left behind at an earlier stage, and more particularly those who fell behind during the ancient Egyptian period. The civilization to which we are referring is our own. We live at a time when, side by side with the normal directors of humanity, others are interposing who were left behind in the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic period.",

In the subsequent Graeco-Roman era, these beings were unable to exercise their powers as they were replaced by other guiding spirits, and the prevailing conditions made their involvement impossible. Just as beings who had not achieved the angelic stage on the old Moon were later tasked with actively participating in human evolution during the earth-period, similarly, the beings who had halted their development as guiding spirits in the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization were later assigned the mission, as lagging beings, to once again impact civilization. The text suggests observing a later civilization period where both the designated guides for normal evolutionary progress and those who fell behind in earlier stages, particularly during the ancient Egyptian period, are simultaneously influencing events. This scenario is likened to our current civilization, where beings from different evolutionary stages are involved in guiding humanity.",

On the one hand our civilization is in the main marked by an upward movement towards spirituality, and this tendency of certain people towards spirituality is the manifestation of the spiritual directors of our contemporary humanity, who have attained their own normal stage of development. In everything which tends to lead man up to the great spiritual wisdom-truths transmitted to us by theosophy, these normal guides of our evolution are manifested. But the beings out-distanced during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization are also affecting the tendencies of our age. They are manifested in much that is being thought and done at the present time, and will again be manifested in what lies in the near future. They are revealed in everything which gives a materialistic stamp to our civilization, and may often be seen even in aspirations after spiritual things. In our age we are virtually experiencing a revival of Egyptian civilization. The beings who are to be looked upon as the invisible directors of what takes place in the physical world, fall accordingly into two classes. The first includes those spiritual individualities who have passed through their own normal course of development up to the present time. Hence they were able to interpose in the guidance of our civilization, whilst the directors of the preceding Graeco-Roman period were gradually finishing their task of guiding civilization during the first thousand years of Christianity. The second class, who work simultaneously with the first class of beings, are spiritual individualities who did not complete their evolution during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. They were obliged to remain inactive during the ensuing Graeco-Roman period, but are now able to resume their activity because our present age has points of resemblance to the Egypto-Chaldæic period. It thus comes about that many things arise in contemporary humanity which look like a revival of ancient Egyptian forces, but there is also much which is like a materialistic resuscitation of forces which then worked spiritually. To illustrate this, we may point to an example of the way in which ancient Egyptian knowledge has been revived in our days.",

The civilization's progression towards spirituality is guided by both normal spiritual directors who have evolved appropriately and beings who lagged behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. These lagging beings influence contemporary thoughts and actions, leading to materialistic inclinations even amidst spiritual pursuits. The current era reflects a resurgence of Egyptian civilization due to the influence of these two classes of spiritual beings. The text emphasizes the interplay between evolved spiritual guides and those who were inactive in previous periods but are now able to intervene, shaping the current spiritual and materialistic aspects of society, akin to a revival of ancient forces alongside a materialistic resurgence.",

The spiritual influences are attributed to the \"normal guides of our evolution\" who have attained their own stage of development and are leading humanity towards spiritual wisdom-truths. These spiritual directors are described as guiding civilization towards spirituality and theosophy. On the other hand, the materialistic influences are associated with beings who were out-distanced during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. These beings are depicted as affecting contemporary tendencies towards materialism, even when there are aspirations towards spiritual matters. The text suggests that our age is experiencing a revival of Egyptian civilization, with influences from both spiritual and materialistic forces shaping current events. This contrast is further emphasized by the statement that \"many things arise in contemporary humanity which look like a revival of ancient Egyptian forces, but there is also much which is like a materialistic resuscitation of forces which then worked spiritually.\"",

We may certainly entertain the idea that Kepler assimilated the ancient Egyptian wisdom during one of his previous lives, and that it reappears in his soul in a new form, adapted to a later age. That a materialistic impulse should enter our civilization through the Egyptian spirit is quite intelligible, for Egyptian spirituality was wrapped in a vigorous materialism, which found expression, for instance, in their embalming the physical bodies of the dead. This meant that they attached value to the preservation of the physical body. This has come down to us from the Egyptian period in a different form, but in one corresponding to our time. The same forces which had not then run their course, affect our age, but in a different way. The temper of mind which embalmed dead bodies gave rise to that which idolizes the merely material. The Egyptian embalmed dead bodies and thereby preserved what he accounted valuable. He thought that the development of the soul after death was connected with the preservation of the physical, material body. The modern anatomist dissects what he sees, and thinks that in this way he understands the laws of the human organism. Thus in our modern science there are living the forces of the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic world, which then were progressive forces, but which now represent what has lagged behind, and which must be recognized for what they are, if a correct estimate is to be formed of the character of the present time. These forces will injure a man of the present day if he does not know their real significance. He will take no harm from them, but will turn them to good account, if he knows their effect and thereby brings himself into the right relation to them. They have their value, for without them we should not have the present great achievements in technique, industries, etc. They are forces belonging to Luciferic beings of the lowest stage, and the danger lies in the fact that if they are not recognized aright, the materialistic impulses of the present time are thought to be the only possible ones, and the other forces, which lead up to the spiritual world, are not seen. For this reason any clear diagnosis is certain to discern two currents of thought in the present age.",

The text explores how materialistic impulses in modern civilization can be traced back to the Egyptian spiritual and materialistic blend, exemplified by practices like embalming. It delves into how forces from the Egypto-Chaldaic period, which were once progressive, now manifest as lagging behind, impacting modern society. These forces, associated with Luciferic beings, have contributed to technological advancements but pose a risk if not understood correctly, potentially leading to a materialistic worldview that overlooks spiritual dimensions.

In ancient Egypt, the practice of embalming the dead bodies was a way of attaching value to the preservation of the physical body, believing it was connected to the development of the soul after death. This practice has evolved in modern times into a materialistic impulse where the modern anatomist dissects bodies to understand the laws of the human organism. This evolution from embalming to anatomical dissection reflects a shift from valuing the physical body for spiritual reasons to studying it purely from a materialistic perspective. This connection between ancient Egyptian practices and modern anatomical studies highlights the continuity of certain forces from the past that influence present-day attitudes towards the physical body and scientific exploration.\n\nThis is supported by the text: \"The temper of mind which embalmed dead bodies gave rise to that which idolizes the merely material. The Egyptian embalmed dead bodies and thereby preserved what he accounted valuable... Thus in our modern science there are living the forces of the ancient Egyptian and Chaldæic world, which then were progressive forces, but which now represent what has lagged behind... They are forces belonging to Luciferic beings of the lowest stage, and the danger lies in the fact that if they are not recognized aright, the materialistic impulses of the present time are thought to be the only possible ones...\"",

In ancient Egypt, the practice of embalming the dead was seen as a way to preserve the physical body because they believed that the development of the soul after death was connected to the preservation of the physical body. This belief stemmed from a spiritual perspective that valued the physical form as a vessel for the soul's journey beyond death. The text states, \"He thought that the development of the soul after death was connected with the preservation of the physical, material body.\" This practice of preserving the physical body was a manifestation of the Egyptian spirituality wrapped in materialism, which had a deeper significance beyond just physical preservation. It symbolized a belief in the continuity of the soul's journey and the importance of the physical body in that process. This understanding of the connection between the physical and spiritual realms in ancient Egypt has influenced modern science and thought, as indicated in the text, \"The modern anatomist dissects what he sees, and thinks that in this way he understands the laws of the human organism.\" This shows how ancient Egyptian practices and beliefs regarding the preservation of physical bodies have continued to impact and shape perspectives on the relationship between the physical and spiritual aspects of human existence.",

In that case only those forces would be operative which would bring man into the spiritual world by main force. People would be only too ready to yield themselves up to those forces, and would become dreamers. The only life they would wish to know about would be one which is being spiritualized as fast as possible, and their standard of action would be a view of life which showed a certain degree of contempt for what is physical and material. But the present epoch of civilization can only fulfill its mission if the forces of the material world are brought to the fullest perfection, and if thus by degrees their sphere too is won for spirituality. Just as the fairest things may become corrupters and tempters of mankind if pursued in a one-sided way, so if this one-sidedness took root, there would be great danger that all kinds of good efforts would come into manifestation as fanaticism. True though it is that humanity is helped forward by its noble impulses it is also true that wild and fanatical advocacy of the noblest impulses may bring about the worst of results as far as true evolution is concerned. Only when people strive after the highest modestly and sensibly, not out of wild fanaticism, can anything beneficial to the progress of humanity take place. In order that the work done on earth at the present day may have the necessary weight, and that material beings of the physical plane may be understood, the wisdom which directs the government of the world left those forces behind which would normally have completed their evolution during the Egyptian period; and it is they who are now directing man’s attention to physical life.\nIt is obvious from the foregoing that evolution takes place under the influence both of normally progressive beings and of those who lag behind. Clairvoyant vision is able to trace the co-operation of both classes of beings in the supersensible world, and hence is able to comprehend the spiritual events of which the physical facts surrounding humanity are the manifestations.",

Steiner argues that if these beings had not lagged behind, humanity might have been overly inclined towards spiritual pursuits, potentially leading to a disregard for the physical and material aspects of life. He emphasizes the necessity of balancing spiritual and material forces in the present epoch to fulfill civilization's mission. Steiner warns against fanaticism that can arise from an extreme focus on noble impulses, highlighting the importance of pursuing progress with modesty and sensibility. By leaving behind forces that did not complete their evolution in the past, these beings now draw attention to the significance of physical existence. Steiner concludes by suggesting that understanding the interplay between normally progressive beings and those lagging behind is crucial for comprehending spiritual events underlying physical manifestations in human life.",

This only means that we see what is there, that we are cognizant of spiritual beings and know that they are entities of the soul-world or spirit-sphere. But it is also necessary to recognize what kinds of beings they are. We may meet some being of the soul or spirit world, but we do not necessarily know whether it is progressing in its evolution, or whether it belongs to the category of powers that have lagged behind; whether therefore it is pushing evolution onwards, or hindering it. Those people who acquire clairvoyant faculties and do not at the same time gain complete understanding of the conditions of human evolution which we have described may know absolutely nothing of the nature of the beings whom they meet. Mere clairvoyance must be supplemented by clear judgment of what is seen in the supersensible world. There is urgent necessity for this especially in our own time, but it had not always to be so much considered. If we go back to very ancient civilizations, we find different conditions. If in the most ancient Egyptian times a person was clairvoyant, and was confronted with a being from the supersensible world, the latter had, as it were, written on his forehead who he was. The clairvoyant could not mistake him. Now, however, the possibility of misunderstanding is very great. Whereas humanity in early times still stood very near the kingdom of the spiritual hierarchies and could see what beings it was meeting, it is now very easy to be mistaken, and the only protection against being severely injured is the effort to gain ideas and conceptions like those indicated above.",

Rudolf Steiner explains that while a clairvoyant can see into higher realms, an Initiate goes further by being able to discern and differentiate between different types of spiritual beings and events.

However, in the present era, the risk of misinterpretation is significant, emphasizing the necessity for individuals undergoing esoteric training to prioritize acquiring initiation alongside developing clairvoyant abilities.

With all our human endeavor and power of perception, we cannot reach a spiritual world.

What they could find out for themselves then became limited to the physical world of sense. Afterwards, however, came the time when there was more and more possibility of again winning a view of the spiritual world. But the new clairvoyance was of a different kind from the old, which virtually became extinct just about the year 1250. In the new form of clairvoyance, western esotericism was obliged strictly to uphold the principle that initiation must be the guide of spiritual sight and hearing. This was the special task assigned to an esoteric current which then entered the stream of European civilization. As the year 1250 drew near there arose a new kind of guidance into the supersensible worlds.\nThis guidance was prepared by the spirits then standing behind outer historical events, who centuries before had provided for the kind of esoteric training which would be rendered necessary by the conditions prevailing in 1250. If the term “modern esotericism” be not misused, it may be applied to the spiritual work of those very highly evolved personalities. External history knows nothing of them, but what they did is apparent in every form of civilization which has developed since the thirteenth century.",

Quite enlightened individuals were as though cut off from the spiritual world, and their only knowledge of it was through their remembrance of earlier incarnations. Thus we see how necessary it was that from that time onwards a new element should be brought into the spiritual guidance of humanity. This element was true modern esotericism.

It discusses how even highly evolved individuals, reincarnated around 1250, experienced a temporary loss of direct spiritual perception, relying solely on memories of past lives. This period marked the necessity for a new form of spiritual guidance, termed modern esotericism, which allowed for a deeper understanding of the Christ-impulse's role in guiding both humanity and individuals. This shift in spiritual guidance was crucial for navigating the complexities of spiritual evolution and ensuring a balanced approach to spiritual knowledge and insight.",

During that period, people received Christ to a certain degree unconsciously as far as their higher spirit-forces were concerned, and this caused them afterwards, when they were obliged to receive them consciously, to make all kinds of mistakes, and to lose themselves in a maze instead of understanding Christ. In primitive Christian times we may trace the adoption of the Christ-principle by the lower soul-forces. Then came a new period, in which mankind of to-day is still living. Indeed, in a certain respect, people are only now beginning to understand the Christ principle with the higher faculties of their souls. In the further course of this work it will be shown that the decline of supersensible knowledge down to the thirteenth century, and on the other hand its slow revival since that time, coincide with the interposition of the Christ-impulse in human evolution.\nWe may therefore take modern esotericism to mean the raising of the Christ-impulse to be the motive power in the guidance of souls desiring to work their way to a knowledge of higher worlds, in accordance with the evolutionary conditions of modern times.",

            "text": "In accordance with what has been said in the preceding chapters, the spiritual guidance of the course of human evolution may be sought for among those beings who went through their stage of humanity during the previous embodiment of the Earth-planet, i.e., during the ancient Moon period. This guidance stood contrasted with another which checked, and yet in a certain sense furthered, whilst checking the first, and which was carried out by those beings who had not completed their own evolution during the Moon-period. Reference is made in both these cases to those guiding beings immediately above man to those who lead humanity forward, and to those who provoke resistance, thereby strengthening and confirming the forces arising through the progressive beings, by bestowing on them balance and individuality. In Christian Esotericism, these two classes of superhuman beings are called Angels (Angeloi). Above these beings in an ascending order, stand those of the higher hierarchies, the Archangels, the Archai, etc., who likewise take part in the guidance of humanity.\n\nWithin the ranks of these different beings there are all possible gradations in regard to perfection. In the category of the Angels there are at the beginning of the present Earth-evolution, some standing high and others less developed. The former have progressed far beyond the minimum of their Moon-development. Between these and those who had just reached this minimum when the Moon-evolution had come to an end, and the Earth-evolution had begun, there are all possible gradations. Conformably with this gradation of rank, the beings in question entered during the Earth-period upon the leadership of human evolution. Thus the evolution of the Egyptian civilization was effected under the guidance of beings who had become more perfected on the Moon than those who were the leaders of the Graeco-Roman period, and these again were more perfect than those who have the leadership at the present time. In the Egyptian as also in the Greek Period, those who later on assumed the direction, were meanwhile developing, and making themselves ready to guide the civilization of later periods.\n\nSince the time of the great Atlantean catastrophe, seven consecutive epochs of civilization have to be differentiated; the first is the ancient Indian epoch, and it is followed by the ancient Persian.[2] The third is the Egypto-Chaldæic, the fourth is the Graeco-Roman, and the fifth is our own, which, since about the twelfth century, has been gradually developing and in which we are still living. And as the separate periods overlap, we see already in our times those early events preparing which will lead over into the sixth post-Atlantean epoch. And a seventh epoch will succeed the sixth in due course. On closer observation we find the following evidence with regard to the guidance of mankind. It was during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic, that the Angels (or lower dhyanic beings according to Oriental mysticism) were to some extent independent leaders of humanity. They were not so during the ancient Persian civilization. For then they were subject to a higher direction in a much greater degree than in the Egyptian times, and had to regulate everything in conformity with the impulses of the hierarchies immediately above them. In this way everything was under the immediate guidance of the Angels, but these themselves submitted to the rulership of the Archangels. And in the Indian epoch when post-Atlantean life had reached such a height in spiritual matters as has never been attained since a natural height under the direction of great human teachers then the Archangels themselves were subject in a similar sense to the guidance of the Archai or Primal Powers. Thus if we trace the evolution of humanity from the Indian epoch through the ancient Persian and Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, we may say that certain beings of the higher hierarchies withdrew as it were, ever more and more from the direct guidance of humanity. And in the fourth post-Atlantean period of civilization, i.e., the Graeco-Roman epoch, man had become in a certain sense quite independent. The guiding superhuman beings were certainly intervening to develop humanity, but only in such a way that the reins were tightened as little as possible, and also that the spiritual leaders themselves might profit as much through the deeds of men as men profited through them. Hence arose that peculiar and quite “human” civilization in the Graeco-Roman time in which man was made to rely entirely on himself. For all the distinctive characteristics of Art and political life in Greek and Roman times are traceable to the fact that man had to live out his own life in his own way.\n\nSo, when we look back to the most ancient times of civilization, we then find evolution guided by beings who had accomplished their evolution as far as the human stage, in earlier planetary conditions. But the fourth post-Atlantean period of civilization was intended as a time when man should be put to the test as much as possible, and consequently was the time when the whole spiritual guidance of humanity had to be re-organized. We are now living in the fifth post-Atlantean period of civilization. The leading beings of this period belong to the same hierarchy as that which ruled the ancient Egyptians and Chaldæans. In fact those beings who then took the lead, have again begun to be active in our times, for it has been stated that certain beings remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, and that these are to be found manifested in the materialistic feelings and perceptions of our own period.\n\nNow the progress made by the beings of each class of Angels or lower dhyanic beings the class which leads mankind forward and the class which obstructs consists in their being able to be leaders among the Egyptians and Chaldæans by means of those qualities which they had acquired in primordial times, and which they had further developed by their work as leaders. Thus the progressive Angels are intervening to guide the fifth post-Atlantean civilization by means of capacities which they themselves had won during the third or Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. Through the progress they make they are acquiring for themselves quite special capabilities, for they are qualifying themselves to receive the influx of forces emanating from the most important Being in the whole evolution of the Earth. The power of the Christ is working in them; for that power works not only on the physical world through Jesus of Nazareth but also in the spiritual worlds upon the superhuman beings. The Christ exists not only for the earth but also for these other beings. The beings who guided the old Egypto-Chaldæic civilization were not at that time under the direction of the Christ, but have only placed themselves under His guidance since. And their progress consists in their following Him in the higher worlds, so that they may guide our fifth post-Atlantean period of civilization in accordance with His influence. And the remaining behind of those beings of whom it has been said that they operate as obstructive powers, is due to their not having put themselves under the leadership of the Christ, and thus they continue to work independently of Him. Hence the following state of things will become more and more evident in human evolution: There will be a materialistic movement under the guidance of the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits. It will have a materialistic character, and the greater part of what in all countries, may be called contemporary materialistic science is under this influence. There are, for example, people to-day who say that our earth in its primary origin consisted of atoms. Who instils this thought into men’s minds? It is the superhuman angel beings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic period. But, side by side with this movement, there is another making itself felt, the one which has as its goal that man shall eventually find in all that he does, that which may be called the Christ-principle.\n\nNow what will those beings teach who attained their goal in the old Egypto-Chaldæic sphere of civilization, and who then learned to know the Christ? They will be able to instill into man other thoughts than that there are only material atoms; for they will be able to teach that, even to the minutest particle of the world, the substance is permeated with the Spirit of the Christ. And, strange as it may seem, there will be in the future, chemists and physicists who will not teach chemistry and physics as they are now taught under the influence of the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits; but who will teach that “Matter is built up in the way in which the Christ gradually ordained it.” The Christ will be found working even in the very laws of chemistry and physics. It is a spiritual chemistry, and spiritual physics that will come in the future. To-day such a statement appears certainly to many people as something fanciful or worse than that, but in many cases the sense of the future is folly to the past. The factors which in this sense enter into the evolution of human civilization are already there for the careful observer; but such an one will know quite well the objections which may, with apparent justice, be urged against such alleged folly from the modern scientific or philosophic point of view.\n\nFrom such hypotheses we are able to understand what advantage the guiding superhuman beings have compared with man. Humanity learned to know Christ in the fourth civilization period of the post-Atlantean times, i.e., in the Graeco-Roman epoch, for it was in the course of this civilization that the Christ-event found its place in evolution, and it was then that man learned to know the Christ. The guiding superhuman beings, however, learned to know Him during the Egypto-Chaldæic times, and worked themselves up to Him. Then during the Graeco-Roman civilization they had to leave man to his own fate in order that, later on, they might re-enter the sphere of human evolution. And if nowadays theosophy is cultivated, that signifies nothing else than a recognition of the fact that the superhuman beings who formerly guided humanity are now continuing their task as leaders in such a way as to be under the direct guidance of the Christ themselves. Thus it is with other beings also.\n\nIn the ancient Persian epoch, the leadership of humanity was apportioned to the Archangels. They put themselves under the direction of the Christ earlier than did the beings in the rank next below them. Of Zarathustra it can be said that pointing to the sun, he spoke to his followers and his people in some such words as these: “In the sun there lives the great Spirit Ahura Mazdao, who will one day come down to the earth.” For the beings out of the region of the Archangels who guided Zarathustra, pointed to the great sun-leader, who had not at that time come down upon the earth, but had only begun his journey thither in order, later on, to enter directly into the earth evolution. And the guiding beings who directed the great teachers of the Indians, also pointed these to the Christ of the future; for it is a mistake to think that these teachers had no foreknowledge of the Christ. They said that He was “beyond their sphere” and that they “could not attain” unto Him.\n\nAs now in our fifth period of civilization, it is the Angels who bring down the Christ into our spiritual evolution, so the sixth period of civilization will be directed by beings who belong to the ranks of the Archangels who guided the ancient Persian civilization. And spirits of Personality the Primal Powers or Archai who guided humanity during the ancient Indian epoch will have to guide humanity in the seventh period of civilization. In the Graeco-Roman period, the Christ descended from the heights of the spirit-world and revealed Himself in the physical body of Jesus of Nazareth. He then came down as far as the physical world. It will be possible to find Him in the world immediately above ours when humanity shall have become sufficiently ripe. It will not be possible in the future to find Him in the physical world, but only in the world immediately above, for human beings will not always remain the same; they will become more mature, and will then find the Christ in the spiritual world, as Paul found Him in his experience before Damascus, which event prophetically foreshadowed the future means of finding the Christ. And since in our times the same great teachers who have already guided mankind through the Egyptian Civilization are working, so also in the twentieth century it will be these same teachers who will lead men out to behold the Christ as Paul beheld Him. They will show mankind how the Christ not only works upon the earth, but how He spiritualizes the whole solar system. And those who will be the reincarnated holy teachers of India in the seventh period of civilization will proclaim the Spirit Who was foreshadowed through the undivided Brahma, to whom however the right content and meaning could only be given through the Christ, as the great, the immense Spirit, of Whom they formerly said that He hovered above their sphere. Thus will humanity be led upwards from stage to stage into the spiritual world.\nTo speak in this way about the Christ how He is the leader of the higher hierarchies also in the successive worlds, is to teach the science which, under the title of modern esotericism, has endured into our civilization since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and which, as has been shown, had from that time become necessary. If from this aspect we observe more closely the Being Who lived in Palestine, and Who consummated the Mystery of Golgotha, then we find the following:\n\nUp to the present time many ideas concerning the Christ have found expression. There was for instance the idea of certain Christian Gnostics in the first centuries, who said that the Christ Who lives in Palestine was not present in any physical body of flesh at all; that He had only an apparent body an etheric body which had become physically visible; so that His death on the Cross had been no real death but only an apparent one, for the very reason that only an etheric body was present. Then we find the various disputes among those who professed Christianity, as for example, the well-known controversy between the Arians and Athenatians, etc., and the most varied explanations concerning what the Christ really was. And indeed right up to our own times people express and have expressed the most varied ideas concerning the Christ.\n\nNow spiritual science must recognize in Christ not merely an earthly but also a cosmic Being. In a certain sense man is, taken as a whole, a cosmic being. He lives a twofold life one in a physical body from birth to death, another in the spiritual worlds between death and a new birth. When he is incarnated in a physical body, he is living in dependence on the earth, because the physical body is restricted by the forces and conditions of existence belonging to the earth. A man, however, does not only take the substances and forces of the earth into himself, but is joined to the whole of the earth’s organism. When he has passed through the gate of death, he does not any longer belong to the forces of the earth; but it would be incorrect to imagine that he then belongs to no forces at all, for he is then connected with the forces of the solar system and the more distant star-systems. In this way, between death and a new birth, he lives in the domain of the cosmic, just as in the period between birth and death he lived in the domain of the earthly. From death to a new birth he belongs to the cosmos, as on the earth he belongs to the elements Air, Water, and Earth. Accordingly, while he is passing through a life between death and a new birth, he comes into the region of cosmic influences, for the planets send forth not merely the physical forces of what astronomy teaches, such as gravitation and others, but also spiritual forces, and with these spiritual powers of the cosmos man is connected each person in a special manner according to his own individuality. If he is born in Europe, he lives in a different relation to warmth conditions, etc., than if he had been born, let us say, in Australia. Similarly, during his life between death and a new birth, one person may stand more closely related to the spiritual powers of Mars, another to those of Jupiter, others again to those of the whole planetary system in general, and so on. It is also these forces which bring man back again to the earth. Thus before he is born he is living in connection with the collective whole of stellar space.\n\nAccording to the way in which a man stands individually related to the cosmic system, so are the forces directed which lead him to this or that set of parents and to this or that locality. The impetus, the inclination to incarnate here or there, in this or that family, in this or that people, at this or that time, depends on how the person was organically connected with the cosmic before birth. In former times, in that territory where the German tongue was spoken, a specially apt expression was used whereby to indicate a person’s entrance into the world through birth. When a person was born, people said that in such and such a place he had “become young” (jung-geworden). Therein lies an unconscious reference to the fact that man in the time between death and a new birth continues at first to be subject to the powers which had made him old in a previous incarnation, but that before birth there come in their place such forces as again make him “young.” Thus Goethe in “Faust” still uses the expression “to become young in Nebelland” Nebelland being the old name for mediæval Germany.\n\nThe truth underlying the casting of a horoscope is that those who know these things can read the forces which determine a person’s physical existence. A certain horoscope is allotted to a person because, within it, those forces find expression which have led him into being. If, for example, in the horoscope, Mars stands over Aries (the Ram) that signifies that certain of the Aries forces are not allowed to pass through Mars and are weakened. Thus is a man put into his place within physical existence, and it is in accordance with his horoscope that he guides himself before entering upon earthly existence. This subject, which in our times seems so much a thing of chance should not be touched upon without our attention being called to the fact that nearly everything practiced in this connection to-day is simply dilettantism a pure superstition and that for the external world the true science of these matters has been for the most part completely lost. Consequently, the principal things which have been said here are not to be judged according to that which nowadays frequently leads a questionable existence under the name of Astrology.\n\nNow it is the active forces of the stellar world that impel man into physical incarnation; and when clairvoyant consciousness observes a person, it can perceive in his organization how this has resulted from the co-operation of cosmic forces. We may now attempt to illustrate this hypothetically, but in a form corresponding entirely with clairvoyant observations: If a person’s physical brain were extracted and its construction clairvoyantly examined, so that it might be seen how certain parts are situated in certain places, and send out appendages, it would be found that the brain of each individual is different. No two people have brains alike. Then let us imagine further that this brain could be photographed in its complete structure so that one would have a kind of half-sphere in which every detail was visible, then this would make a different picture in the case of each person. And if one were to photograph a person’s brain at the moment of birth and then photograph also the heavens lying exactly over the person’s birthplace, then this latter picture would be of exactly the same appearance as that of the human brain.\nAs certain centres were arranged in the latter, so would the stars be in the photograph of the heavens. Man has within himself a picture of the heavens, and every man has a different one, according to whether he was born in this place or that, and at this or that time. This is one indication that man is born from out of the whole cosmos.\nWhen we keep this clearly in view we can rise to the idea of how the macrocosm manifests itself in each separate individual, and then, starting from this point, we can attain a conception of how it showed itself in the Christ. But if we were to imagine the Christ after the Baptism of John as though the macrocosm had then been living in Him in the same way as in other people, we should be mistaken.\n\nLet us first consider Jesus of Nazareth: His conditions of existence were quite exceptional. At the beginning of our era two boys were born and named Jesus. The one came through the Nathan line of the house of David, and the other through the Solomon line of the same house. These two children were not born quite at the same time, but nearly so. In the Jesus descended from Solomon, Who is described in the Gospel of St. Matthew, there was incarnated the same individuality who had formerly lived on the earth as Zarathustra, so that in this Child Jesus there appears the reincarnated Zarathustra or Zoroaster. The individuality of Zarathustra grew up in this Child until, as St. Matthew says, His twelfth year. In that year, Zarathustra left the body of this Child and passed over into that of the other Child Jesus Whom the Gospel of St. Luke describes. In consequence of this the latter child became suddenly quite different. The parents were astonished when they found Him in Jerusalem in the temple after the spirit of Zarathustra had entered into Him. This is intimated when it is said that the Child after having been lost and found again in the temple, so spake that his parents did not recognize Him. They only knew Him the Child descended from Nathan as He had been before up to this time. But when He began to reason with the doctors in the temple, it was possible for Him to speak as He did because the spirit of Zarathustra had come into Him. Until the thirtieth year did the spirit of Zarathustra live in the Jesus who was descended from the Nathan line of the house of David. In this body He ripened to a still higher perfection. The remark must here be added that as regards this personality in which the spirit of Zarathustra now lived, an extraordinary feature was, that from the spiritual worlds the Buddha rayed forth his impulses into its astral body.\n\nThe oriental tradition is correct which says that the Buddha was born as a “Bodhisatva,” and only during his time on earth, in his twenty-ninth year, rose to the dignity of a Buddha. When the Gautama Buddha was a little child, the Indian sage Asita came weeping into the royal palace of his father, Suddhodana. He wept because, as a seer, he knew that this King’s son would become the Buddha, and because as an old man, he felt that he would no longer be living to see that event take place. Now this sage was born again in the time of Jesus of Nazareth. It is he who is brought before us in the Gospel of St. Luke as the priest of the temple who saw the revelation of the Buddha in the Child Jesus descended from Nathan. And seeing this he was able to say: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace for I have seen my Master.” What he had not been able to see previously in India, he saw through the astral body of the Boy Jesus, Who comes before us in St. Luke’s Gospel, the Bodhisatva become a Buddha.\n\nAll this was necessary in order that that body might be produced which received the baptism of St. John in the Jordan. At that moment the individuality of Zarathustra left the threefold body, the physical, the etheric and the astral body of that Jesus Who had grown up in so complicated a manner, in order that the spirit of Zarathustra might be able to dwell in Him. Through two possibilities of development which were given in the two Jesus-Children, the reincarnated Zarathustra had to pass, and thus there stood before the Baptist the body of Jesus of Nazareth and in it from that time onwards there acted the cosmic individuality of the Christ. Now, as we have shown, in the case of any other human being, the cosmic spiritual laws work upon him only in so far that they give him a start in earth-life. Afterwards there appear in opposition to these laws, others which arise out of the conditions of the earth-evolution. In the case of the Christ Jesus, after the baptism of John the cosmic-spiritual forces alone remained effective without being influenced in any way through the laws of the earth evolution.\n\nThus in Palestine during the time that Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth as Christ-Jesus, during the three last years of his life, from his thirtieth to his thirty-third year, the entire Being of the cosmic Christ was acting uninterruptedly upon Him, and was working into Him. The Christ stood always under the influence of the entire cosmos He made no step without this working of the cosmic forces into and in Him. That which here took place in Jesus of Nazareth was a continual realization of the horoscope, for at every moment there occurred that which otherwise happens only at a person’s birth. This could be so only because the whole body of Jesus descended from Nathan had remained open to the influence of the sum total of the forces of the cosmic spiritual hierarchies which direct our earth. If thus the whole spirit of the cosmos worked into the Christ Jesus, who was it that went, for example, to Capernaum or anywhere else? He who went about as a being upon the earth appeared quite like any other man. The forces active within Him, however, were the cosmic forces, coming from the sun and stars; and these directed His body. And it was always in accordance with the collective Being of the whole Universe with whom the earth is in harmony, that all which the Christ Jesus did took place. It is because of this that in the case of the acts of the Christ Jesus there is so often some slight hint given in the Gospels, about the relative grouping of the stars at the time. We read in St. John’s Gospel how the Christ finds His first disciples. There we are told: “It was about the tenth hour,” because in this fact the spirit of the whole cosmos found expression in conformity with the appointed moment of time. Such intimations are less clear in the other Gospel passages, but he who can truly read the Gospel finds them everywhere. From this point of view also the miracles are to be judged. Let us take one passage, The one that runs thus: “When the sun was set, they brought the sick unto Him, and He healed them.” What does that mean? The evangelist is drawing attention to the fact that this healing was connected with the whole position of the constellations, and that at the time in question, the constellations throughout the heavens stood in such a way as could only have happened when the sun had set. The meaning of that, at the time, the requisite healing forces could make themselves felt after sun-set, and the Christ Jesus is represented as the intermediary Who brought the sick into connection with the forces of the cosmos which, just at that time could work curatively. These forces were the same as those which worked as Christ in Jesus. It was through the presence of Christ that the healing took place, because in consequence of the same, the sick person was exposed to the healing forces of the Cosmos which could only work as they did when they were in the right relationship to time and space. Thus these forces worked on the sick person through their representative the Christ. But it was only just during the time of Christ on earth that they could so work. It was only then that such a connection existed between the cosmic constellations and the powers of the human organism, that for certain illnesses, healing could intervene when through the instrumentality of the Christ Jesus, the cosmic grouping of the same forces was able to work on men. A repetition of this relationship in the evolution of the cosmos and the earth is as little possible as is a second incarnation of the Christ in a human body. Regarded in this way, the life of the Christ Jesus appears as the earthly expression of a definite connection between the cosmos and the forces of man. The tarrying of a sick person by the side of Christ means that through the proximity of Christ, this sick person found himself in such a relation with the macrocosm that the latter could work upon him curatively.\n\nTherewith the points of view have been specified which enable us to discern how the guidance of humanity has come under the influence of the Christ. The other forces, however, which had remained behind in the Egypto-Chaldæic times worked further side by side with those that are permeated by the Christ. This is evident even in the attitude frequently adopted to-day towards the Gospels. Literary works appear in which great pains are taken to show that the Gospels can be understood through an astrological interpretation. The greatest opponents of the Gospels employ this astrological interpretation in such a manner that, the way, for example, taken by the Archangel Gabriel from Elizabeth to Mary is supposed to signify nothing more than the progress of the sun from the constellation of Virgo to another. This, in a certain sense, is correct, except that these thoughts were poured in this manner into our age by the beings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic Period. Under such an influence people are induced to a make-belief that the Gospels present only allegories in the place of definite cosmic relations. The truth really is, that in the Christ the whole cosmos finds expression and therefore one can express the life of the Christ by connecting its separate events with the cosmic relations which work into Earth existence unceasingly through the Christ. A right understanding of this matter will thus lead to a full recognition of the Christ, as having lived on earth, whereas the above mentioned error, if it were true, would mean that the Christ life in the Gospels is expressed by cosmic constellation and shows that it was only a matter of constellations being treated allegorically, and that there was no real earthly Christ at all.\n\nIf a comparison were to be used, we might think of each human being as represented by a spherical mirror which, if it were set up, would give pictures of all its surroundings. Let us suppose we were to trace with a pencil the outline of all that is shown from the surroundings. We could then take the mirror and carry the picture about with us wherever we went. Let this be a symbol for the fact that when a person is born, he brings with him a copy of the cosmos in himself, and afterwards carries about with him all through his life the effect of this one picture. The mirror might, however, be left untouched by the pencil, so that wherever the person carried it, it would depict the immediate surroundings. It then would always be giving a picture of the collective environment. This would be a symbol of the Christ from the baptism by St. John up to the mystery of Golgotha. That which, in the case of any other person, passes into his earthly existence at birth only flowed into the Christ-Jesus at every moment. And when the mystery of Golgotha was consummated, that which had been radiating from out the cosmos passed over into the spiritual substance of the earth, and has from that time forward been united with the spirit of the earth.\nWhen St. Paul became clairvoyant before Damascus, he could recognize that That which had formerly been in the cosmos has passed over into the spirit of the earth. Of this every one can be convinced who can bring his soul into such a condition that he can have the same experience as had St. Paul. It is in the twentieth century that those people will first appear who will have St. Paul’s experience of the Christ event in a spiritual way.\n\nWhereas up to our times this event would be experienced only by such persons as had gained clairvoyant powers by means of an esoteric training, hereafter to look upon the Christ in the spiritual sphere surrounding the earth will be possible for the advanced powers of the soul in the course of the natural evolution of humanity. This as a repeated experience of the event before Damascus will be possible for some people from a certain point of time in the twentieth century. The number of such people will afterwards increase, until in the distant future, it will be a natural faculty of the human soul.\n\nWith the entrance of Christ into the evolution of the earth an entirely new impulse or direction was given to evolution. External facts of history also express this. In the early times of post-Atlantean evolution men knew very well that above them there was not merely a physical Mars, but that what they saw as Mars, Jupiter or Saturn was the expression for a spiritual being. In later times this perception was completely forgotten. The heavenly bodies became, according to human ideas, mere bodies to be estimated according to their physical condition. And in the Middle Ages people saw in connection with the stars only what the eyes can see the sphere of Venus, the sphere of the Sun, the sphere of Mars, etc., up to the sphere of the fixed stars; and then came the eighth sphere like a solid blue wall behind. Then Copernicus appeared and broke down the idea that only that which is perceptible to the senses can be authoritative. The modern physical scientists may indeed say: “It is madness to declare that the world is Maya, or illusion, and that you must look into a spiritual world in order to see the truth, for in spite of all you say true science is that which relies on the senses and notifies what these senses tell.” But when did astronomers rely only on the senses? Surely at the very time when that astronomical science was dominant which is attacked by the science of to-day! It was at that time when Copernicus began to think out what exists in the cosmic space beyond the evidence of the senses, that our modern astronomy as a science began. And so it is in every domain of science. Everywhere that science, in the most modern sense of the word, has arisen, it has done so in opposition to what had been apparent to the senses. When Copernicus declared “what you see is Maya or deception, rely on what you cannot see,” then the science came into being which is recognized as such to-day. It might thus be said to the representative of modern science “your science itself only became ‘science’ when it was no longer willing to depend upon the senses only.”\n\nGiordano Bruno came as philosophical interpreter of the teachings of Copernicus. He led the gaze of man out into cosmic space, and announced that what people had called the limitations of space, what they had placed there as the eighth sphere limiting everything in space was in reality no limitation; it was Maya, or illusion; for an infinite number of worlds had been poured forth into cosmic space. That which was formerly considered to be the boundary of space was shown to be only the boundary of the sense-world of man, and if we direct our gaze beyond the sense-world, we shall no longer see the world only as known to the senses, but we shall also recognize Infinity.\n\nFrom this it is apparent how the course of human evolution has been such that man started from an originally spiritual view of the cosmos and in the course of time lost it. In its place there came a mere sense-perception of the world. Then there came into evolution the Christ Impulse. Through this, mankind was led to stamp the spiritual view once more upon the materialistic. At that moment when Giordano Bruno burst the fetters of the sense illusion, the Christ evolution was so far advanced, that the soul power, which had been kindled by the Christ Impulse, could then be active within him. Therewith an indication is given of the whole significance of how the life of Christ penetrates all human evolution, an evolution only at the beginning of which humanity stands to-day.\nTo what then does spiritual science now aspire? It completes the work begun for external science by Giordano Bruno and others in that it says: that which external science is able to perceive is Maya, or illusion. Just as formerly one looked to the “eighth sphere” and thought that space was thereby bounded, so contemporary human thought believes that man is shut in or enclosed between birth and death. Spiritual science, however, expands man’s vision by directing his attention out and beyond the limits of birth and death.\n\nThere is a continuous chain in human evolution which such ideas as these make us recognize. And in the true sense of the words, that which resulted in the conquest of sense illusion through Copernicus and Giordano Bruno, already proceeded from the inspiration due to that spiritual current which is now working in the modern spiritual science of theosophy. What one might call the newer esotericism worked in a mysterious manner on Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler and others. Those therefore who now stand, base their thought on foundations laid by Giordano Bruno and Copernicus and do not wish to accept theosophy, are unfaithful to their own traditions in desiring to hold fast by sense illusion. But spiritual science demonstrates that, as Giordano Bruno forced a way through the blue firmament of heaven, even so does this science break down the barriers of birth and death for man by showing how he originates from out of the macrocosm, lives in a physical existence, passes through death, and re-enters macrocosmic life. And what we see in a limited degree in each individual meets us unrestrictedly and in a larger sense in the representative of the spirit of the cosmos in the Christ-Jesus. Once and once only could that impulse be given which the Christ gave. Once only could the whole cosmos be thus reflected, for the conjunction of the stars which then took place can never be repeated. In order to give an impulse to the earth, this conjunction was obliged to work through a human body. As it is true that this same grouping cannot occur a second time, so it is equally true that the Christ was only once incarnated. Only if one did not know that the Christ is the representative of the whole universe and only if it were impossible to win one’s way to this Christ-Idea, the elements for which are given through spiritual science only then would it be possible to maintain that Christ could appear more than once upon the earth.\n\nThus we see how an idea of Christ arises out of the new spiritual science or theosophy, which reveals to man in a new form his connection with the whole macrocosm. Certainly, in order to gain a true knowledge of the Christ, those inspiring forces are absolutely necessary which are now being bestowed by those same superhuman beings who formerly guided the Egypto-Chaldæic epoch and who have now put themselves under the Christ. There is need of a new inspiration of this kind, of an inspiration which the great esoteric teachers of the middle ages had prepared from the thirteenth century onwards, and which from this time forth must ever come more and more into publicity. When man, according to the meaning of this science, prepares his soul aright for the knowledge of the spirit-world, he can then hear clairaudiently and he can see clairvoyantly what is revealed by the old Chaldæic and Egyptian angel beings who are now again acting as spiritual leaders under the guidance of the Christ. That which humanity will some time later actually gain thereby could only be prepared in the first centuries of Christianity and up to our times.\n\nConsequently we may say that in the future there will live in the hearts of men an idea of the Christ incomparable in greatness with anything which humanity has so far recognized. That which arose as a first impulse through the Christ, and has lived as an idea of Him up to the present time even in the case of the best representatives of the Christ-principle is only a preparation for the true understanding of the Christ. It would be strange indeed if, against those who in the West gave expression in such a way as this to the Christ-idea, it were brought as a reproach that they do not stand on the foundation of western Christian tradition, but it is quite possible, for this western tradition does not by any means suffice to help us to comprehend the Christ of the near future.\n\nFrom the hypothesis of eastern esotericism we can see the spiritual direction of humanity gradually flowing into what may be in a real, true sense called the guidance, which comes from the Christ-impulse. That which is appearing as the new esotericism will flow slowly into the hearts of men, and the spiritual guidance of men and of humanity will ever more and more be consciously seen in such a light. We realize to ourselves how at first the Christ-principle flowed into the hearts of men because the Christ had gone about Palestine in the physical body of Jesus of Nazareth. Later men gradually surrendered themselves entirely to a reliance on the world of sense, and could only receive the impulse which corresponded to their perception. Afterwards that same impulse so worked through the inspiration of the new esotericism that such spirits as Nicholas Cusamus, Copernicus and Galileo were able to be inspired and Copernicus, for instance, was enabled to make this assertion: “That which is evident to the senses cannot teach the truth about the solar system; if we want to find the truth we must investigate behind sense appearances.” At that time men, even spirits like Giordano Bruno, were not yet ripe enough to join consciously to the new esoteric stream. The spirit of the movement had to work in them unconsciously. Yet powerful and magnificent was the announcement of Giordano Bruno: “When a human being enters into existence by means of birth, then it is something macrocosmic that concentrates itself as a monad; and when a human being passes through death the monad spreads itself out again; that which was enclosed within the body spreads itself out in the cosmos in order to draw itself together again in other stages of existence, and again to spread itself out.” There Bruno gave expression to mighty conceptions which, even if expressed in stammering tongue, were yet in entire accord with the sense of the new esotericism.\n\nThe spiritual influences which lead humanity need not work in such a way that man is always conscious of them. For example, they put Galileo in the cathedral of Pisa. Thousands had seen the old church lamp there, but they have not seen it as did Galileo. He saw the church lamp swinging; compared the time of its oscillation with the beat of his own pulse; found that the church lamp swung in a regular rhythm resembling his pulse-beat; and from this discovered the laws of the pendulum in the sense of modern physics. Anyone acquainted with contemporary physics knows that these would not be possible without Galileo’s principle. In this way the force was then working which is now appearing as spiritual science; Galileo was placed in the cathedral of Pisa before the oscillating church lamp, and modern physics gained its principles. In such a mysterious way do the guiding spiritual forces of humanity perform their work.\n\nWe are now approaching the time when people are to become conscious of these guiding powers. We shall always come to a better and better understanding of what has to happen in the future if we rightly understand what is working inspirationally as the new esotericism, and which shows that the same spiritual beings, indicated by the ancient Egyptians when the Greeks asked them about their teachers, who then ruled as gods, are now again assuming control, through having placed themselves under the leadership of the Christ. Ever more and more will men feel how they can cause to reappear in a brighter lustre, in a nobler style and on a higher level, that which was pre-Christian. The consciousness necessary for the present time, which must be an intensified consciousness, ought to give us a feeling of our high duty and great responsibility in reference to the recognition of the spiritual world, and this can only penetrate into our soul when we have recognized in the sense indicated, what is the task of spiritual science.\n[2] By “Ancient Persian” is not meant “Persian” in the usual historic sense, but a pre-historic Asiatic (Iranian) civilization which developed in that land over which, later on, the Persian Kingdom extended.",

Steiner elucidates the complex interplay between beings who have advanced beyond humanity during the ancient Moon period and those who have not, highlighting their contributions to human development through both support and resistance. This dynamic fosters balance and individuality within humanity, with Christian Esotericism identifying these beings as Angels (Angeloi), situated below higher hierarchies like Archangels and Archai.\n\nSteiner introduces the concept of gradations among these spiritual beings, particularly Angels, whose varying degrees of evolution during the Earth's development have significantly influenced the trajectory of human civilizations, from ancient Egyptian to Graeco-Roman periods. This gradation has implications for the leadership and guidance provided to humanity, with more advanced beings steering earlier civilizations and less developed ones guiding later periods, including our current epoch.\n\nThe text outlines seven post-Atlantean epochs of civilization, tracing the evolution of spiritual guidance from the ancient Indian through to the future seventh epoch. Each epoch is characterized by the predominance of different spiritual beings' influence, from Angels to Archangels and Archai, reflecting a gradual withdrawal of higher hierarchies from direct human guidance. This evolution marks a transition towards human independence, particularly evident in the Graeco-Roman period, which emphasized self-reliance in spiritual, artistic, and political life.\n\nSteiner discusses the Christ impulse as a pivotal force in human evolution, working not only through the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth but also influencing spiritual beings themselves. This impulse represents a shift towards a more spiritually enriched understanding of the material world, contrasting with materialistic perspectives influenced by beings who resisted the Christ impulse. The text predicts the emergence of a spiritual science that reconciles materialistic science with spiritual truths, including a new understanding of chemistry and physics informed by the Christ impulse.\n\nThe lecture further explores the cosmic dimension of Christ, presenting Him as a being who transcends earthly limitations and embodies cosmic forces, influencing both human and spiritual beings. This cosmic Christ played a unique role in the evolution of the Earth and humanity, offering a model for understanding the interplay between cosmic forces and human development.\n\nSteiner concludes by emphasizing the importance of modern esotericism, which builds upon the insights of spiritual beings who have aligned themselves with the Christ impulse. This new esotericism, which has been emerging since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, aims to deepen humanity's understanding of the spiritual world and its influence on human evolution. The lecture calls for a renewed recognition of the spiritual forces guiding humanity, urging a conscious engagement with these forces to fulfill humanity's evolving spiritual destiny.",

These beings, having advanced beyond their stage of humanity during the previous embodiment of the Earth-planet, or the ancient Moon period, are instrumental in leading humanity forward. The text explains, \"the spiritual guidance of the course of human evolution may be sought for among those beings who went through their stage of humanity during the previous embodiment of the Earth-planet, i.e., during the ancient Moon period.\" This indicates that their evolutionary progress during the Moon period positions them as key guides for humanity's spiritual development.\n\nThese beings stand in contrast to another group that did not complete their evolution during the Moon period and, while also influencing human evolution, do so by provoking resistance. This resistance, however, serves a purpose as it \"strengthening and confirming the forces arising through the progressive beings, by bestowing on them balance and individuality.\" Thus, the beings who completed their Moon-period evolution contribute to human spiritual guidance by leading humanity and interacting with forces that challenge progress, thereby fostering growth, balance, and individuality among humans.\n\nFurthermore, the text categorizes these guiding beings as Angels (Angeloi) in Christian Esotericism, indicating a hierarchical spiritual structure in which these beings operate directly above humanity to foster its evolution. Their influence is nuanced, involving both direct guidance and the engagement with opposing forces to ensure a balanced and individualized development of human spiritual capacities.\n\nIn summary, the beings who completed their evolution during the ancient Moon period influence the spiritual guidance of human evolution by serving as direct leaders and facilitators of human progress. They interact with opposing forces to ensure that humanity's spiritual development is balanced and individualized, playing a pivotal role in the overarching spiritual hierarchy that guides human evolution.",

The Angels are described as beings immediately above man, divided into two classes: those who lead humanity forward and those who provoke resistance, thereby strengthening and confirming the forces arising through the progressive beings by bestowing on them balance and individuality. This dual role of the Angels involves both guiding humanity and challenging it, which contributes to human development by ensuring a balance between progress and the necessary resistance to foster strength and individuality.\n\nAbove the Angels, in an ascending order, stand the higher hierarchies, including the Archangels and the Archai, who also take part in the guidance of humanity. The text specifies that within the ranks of these different beings, there are all possible gradations in regard to perfection, indicating a complex and nuanced structure of spiritual guidance where beings at various levels of development influence human evolution.\n\nFor example, the evolution of the Egyptian civilization is attributed to the guidance of beings who had become more perfected on the Moon than those who were the leaders of the Graeco-Roman period, illustrating how different epochs of human civilization were influenced by beings of varying degrees of advancement within these spiritual hierarchies.\n\nFurthermore, the text explains that during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldaic, the Angels were to some extent independent leaders of humanity, whereas in other periods, such as the ancient Persian civilization, they were subject to a higher direction to a much greater degree and had to regulate everything in conformity with the impulses of the hierarchies immediately above them. This indicates a dynamic and changing relationship between the different levels of spiritual beings and humanity, where the degree of independence and the nature of guidance provided by the Angels and higher hierarchies vary across different epochs.\n\nIn summary, the Angels (Angeloi) and higher hierarchies like Archangels and Archai play crucial roles in the spiritual guidance of humanity according to Christian Esotericism, with their influence manifesting in various ways across different periods of human civilization.",

This gradation is described as ranging from those Angels who had progressed far beyond the minimum of their development during the Moon period to those who had just reached this minimum at the end of the Moon evolution and the beginning of Earth evolution. The text states, \"In the category of the Angels there are at the beginning of the present Earth-evolution, some standing high and others less developed. The former have progressed far beyond the minimum of their Moon-development.\"\n\nThis gradation among the Angels had a significant impact on the development of human civilization. The more perfected beings, having advanced further in their development during the Moon period, took on leadership roles during different epochs of Earth's evolution. For instance, the evolution of the Egyptian civilization was under the guidance of beings who had become more perfected on the Moon than those who led the Graeco-Roman period. This implies that the level of perfection achieved by these guiding beings during the Moon period influenced the timing and nature of their leadership roles on Earth, as well as the characteristics of the civilizations they guided.\n\nThe text elaborates on this by explaining that \"Thus the evolution of the Egyptian civilization was effected under the guidance of beings who had become more perfected on the Moon than those who were the leaders of the Graeco-Roman period, and these again were more perfect than those who have the leadership at the present time.\" This indicates that the gradation of perfection among the Angels not only determined their roles in guiding human evolution but also influenced the progression and characteristics of human civilizations over time.\n\nFurthermore, the text suggests that the development and readiness of these beings to guide later civilizations were ongoing processes. Even as they guided one epoch, they were simultaneously preparing to lead in future periods, indicating a dynamic and evolving relationship between the gradation of the Angels' perfection and the development of human civilization.",

The text states, \"It was during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic, that the Angels (or lower dhyanic beings according to Oriental mysticism) were to some extent independent leaders of humanity.\" This indicates that during this period, the Angels had a significant role in guiding the spiritual development of humanity.\n\nHowever, this leadership dynamic changes as we move to the ancient Persian civilization, which precedes the Egypto-Chaldæic period. Here, the Angels were not independent but were \"subject to a higher direction in a much greater degree than in the Egyptian times, and had to regulate everything in conformity with the impulses of the hierarchies immediately above them.\" This implies that during the ancient Persian period, the Angels were under the guidance of the Archangels, indicating a transition of spiritual leadership to beings of a higher hierarchy.\n\nFurther elaboration on this transition is provided when discussing the ancient Indian epoch, which precedes the ancient Persian civilization. The text mentions that \"in the Indian epoch when post-Atlantean life had reached such a height in spiritual matters as has never been attained since a natural height under the direction of great human teachers then the Archangels themselves were subject in a similar sense to the guidance of the Archai or Primal Powers.\" This statement highlights that during the ancient Indian epoch, the Archangels, who guided the ancient Persian civilization, were themselves guided by the Archai or Primal Powers, marking another shift in spiritual leadership to an even higher hierarchy of spiritual beings.\n\nTherefore, the transition of spiritual leadership from Angels to Archangels and then to Archai across different epochs of civilization is depicted through the changing roles and levels of independence of these spiritual beings in guiding humanity. This transition reflects a hierarchical structure of spiritual guidance, where higher beings take on more prominent roles in guiding the evolution of humanity as it progresses through different epochs.",

Their progress is characterized by their ability to receive the influx of forces emanating from the Christ, as \"the power of the Christ is working in them\" not only on the physical world through Jesus of Nazareth but also in the spiritual worlds upon these superhuman beings. This indicates that the Christ exists not only for the earth but also for other beings, and their progress consists in following Him in the higher worlds, so they may guide our civilization in accordance with His influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the obstructive beings, or those beings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, operate independently of the Christ. Their remaining behind is attributed to their not having put themselves under the leadership of the Christ, which results in them continuing to work independently of Him. This independence from the Christ's guidance is manifested in the materialistic feelings and perceptions of the current period, with much of what is called contemporary materialistic science being under the influence of these backward spirits.

This evolution is marked by changes in the beings responsible for guiding humanity, their relationship with higher spiritual forces, and the manner in which they influence human civilization.\n\n1. **Ancient Persian Epoch**: During the ancient Persian epoch, the leadership of humanity was apportioned to the Archangels. These beings were under the direction of the Christ earlier than the beings in the rank next below them. The text mentions Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) as an example, indicating that the guiding beings of the Archangels directed great teachers like Zarathustra, pointing to the great sun-leader, Ahura Mazdao, who was to come down to the earth. This period is characterized by a direct influence of the Archangels under the guidance of the Christ, even before His descent to Earth.\n\n    > \"In the ancient Persian epoch, the leadership of humanity was apportioned to the Archangels.\"\n\n2. **Egypto-Chaldæic Civilization**: In the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic period, the Angels (or lower dhyanic beings) were to some extent independent leaders of humanity. This represents a shift where the Angels, not the Archangels, took a more central role in guiding humanity, albeit still under the influence of higher spiritual forces.\n\n    > \"It was during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic, that the Angels were to some extent independent leaders of humanity.\"\n\n3. **Graeco-Roman Epoch**: By the Graeco-Roman epoch, humanity had become more independent, with the guiding superhuman beings intervening to develop humanity but allowing for a greater degree of self-reliance. This period is marked by a \"human\" civilization where the spiritual leaders allowed humans to rely entirely on themselves, reflecting a loosening of the direct spiritual guidance.\n\n    > \"And in the fourth post-Atlantean period of civilization, i.e., the Graeco-Roman epoch, man had become in a certain sense quite independent.\"\n\n4. **Fifth Post-Atlantean Period (Current)**: In the current period, the leading beings belong to the same hierarchy as those that ruled the ancient Egyptians and Chaldæans. However, there is a notable change as these beings have now placed themselves under the guidance of the Christ, influencing the direction of materialistic science and spiritual development.\n\n    > \"The leading beings of this period belong to the same hierarchy as that which ruled the ancient Egyptians and Chaldæans.\"\n\n5. **Future Civilization Periods**: Looking into the future, the sixth period of civilization will be directed by beings who belong to the ranks of the Archangels who guided the ancient Persian civilization. The seventh period will see guidance from spirits of Personality, the Primal Powers or Archai, who guided humanity during the ancient Indian epoch. This indicates a cyclical return to the guidance of higher hierarchies but with humanity having evolved to a higher state of spiritual maturity.\n\n    > \"As now in our fifth period of civilization, it is the Angels who bring down the Christ into our spiritual evolution, so the sixth period of civilization will be directed by beings who belong to the ranks of the Archangels.\"\n\nThroughout these periods, the evolution of humanity's guidance by superhuman beings reflects a complex interplay between independence and spiritual direction, with an overarching movement towards a deeper integration with the Christ impulse and a progression towards higher spiritual maturity and consciousness.",

These conditions include:\n\n1. **The Birth of Two Jesus Children**: At the beginning of our era, two boys named Jesus were born, one through the Nathan line and the other through the Solomon line of the house of David. These two children were not born at exactly the same time but nearly so.\n\n2. **The Incarnation of Zarathustra's Spirit**: In the Jesus descended from Solomon, the individuality who had formerly lived on earth as Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) was incarnated. This means that the spirit of Zarathustra lived in this child until his twelfth year, at which point Zarathustra's spirit left the body of this child and passed over into the other child Jesus, who was descended from the Nathan line.\n\n3. **The Influence of the Buddha**: An extraordinary feature of the personality in which the spirit of Zarathustra then lived (the Jesus from the Nathan line) was that from the spiritual worlds, the Buddha rayed forth his impulses into its astral body. This connection to the Buddha was significant in preparing the body for the reception of the Christ spirit.\n\n4. **The Baptism by John**: At the baptism of John in the Jordan, the individuality of Zarathustra left the threefold body (physical, etheric, and astral) of Jesus of Nazareth, making it possible for the cosmic individuality of the Christ to act in him from that time onwards. This moment marked the culmination of the unique conditions and preparations, allowing the Christ spirit to descend into Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThese conditions collectively prepared Jesus of Nazareth for the reception of the Christ spirit at his baptism, making his body a suitable vessel for the cosmic Christ. The preparation involved not only the physical lineage and the merging of significant spiritual individualities but also the influence of major spiritual figures like the Buddha, all of which contributed to making Jesus of Nazareth the unique figure capable of receiving and embodying the Christ spirit.",

This turning point is marked by the incarnation of the Christ Being into the body of Jesus of Nazareth, which introduced a new impulse into Earth's evolution. This impulse is not just of earthly significance but is also cosmic, affecting both the spiritual and physical realms and guiding the spiritual development of humanity.\n\nOne of the key implications of the Christ event for humanity's spiritual development is the introduction of a new way for humanity to relate to the spiritual world. Before the Christ event, humanity's guidance was predominantly through beings of the higher hierarchies, such as Angels, Archangels, and Archai, who had their own evolution and relationship with the cosmic Christ. The Christ Being, by incarnating on Earth, brought the cosmic forces directly into the earthly realm, making the Christ impulse accessible to humanity in a direct and intimate way. This is described as \"the entire Being of the cosmic Christ was acting uninterruptedly upon Him, and was working into Him\" and that \"the Christ stood always under the influence of the entire cosmos.\"\n\nThe Christ event also marks a shift in the way spiritual forces interact with humanity. Before this event, spiritual guidance was more direct, with spiritual beings intervening in human affairs in a more overt manner. After the Christ event, humanity was given more independence, marking a period where human beings were encouraged to develop their own individuality and freedom, a necessary step for the evolution of consciousness. This is evident in the statement, \"the guiding superhuman beings were certainly intervening to develop humanity, but only in such a way that the reins were tightened as little as possible.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Christ event has implications for the future spiritual development of humanity. It is mentioned that \"in the twentieth century it will be these same teachers who will lead men out to behold the Christ as Paul beheld Him,\" indicating that the Christ impulse will continue to evolve and influence humanity's spiritual development in new ways. This ongoing influence is part of a larger cosmic plan that involves the gradual unfolding of human consciousness and the eventual recognition of Christ not just as an earthly figure but as a cosmic being.\n\nThe Christ event also serves as a model for understanding the relationship between the microcosm (individual human beings) and the macrocosm (the cosmos). It is stated that \"man has within himself a picture of the heavens,\" and the Christ Being's incarnation is the ultimate expression of this principle, showing how the cosmic can manifest within the earthly.\n\nIn conclusion, the Christ event signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Earth and has deep implications for humanity's spiritual development. It introduces a new impulse into human evolution, changes the way spiritual guidance is provided to humanity, and sets the stage for future developments in humanity's spiritual journey. This event is not just of historical significance but continues to influence and shape the spiritual development of humanity in profound ways.",

It diverges from these perspectives by offering a more interconnected and spiritually oriented view of the universe, emphasizing the role of spiritual beings and forces in guiding humanity and the evolution of the cosmos. \n\nThe text builds upon traditional Christian perspectives by acknowledging the significance of Christ not only as an earthly being but also as a cosmic entity. It states, \"spiritual science must recognize in Christ not merely an earthly but also a cosmic Being,\" highlighting that Christ's influence extends beyond the physical world to the spiritual realms and the entire cosmos. This view expands the traditional Christian understanding of Christ by incorporating a broader, cosmic dimension to His existence and role.\n\nFurthermore, modern esotericism diverges from traditional Christian views by discussing the spiritual guidance of humanity through various epochs by different spiritual beings, including Angels, Archangels, and Archai. It suggests that these beings have evolved and have been guided by Christ in their efforts to lead humanity, which introduces a more complex spiritual hierarchy and evolutionary process than is typically found in mainstream Christian doctrine.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, modern esotericism builds upon the recognition of the cosmos's vastness and the laws governing it, as seen in the appreciation of Copernicus's and Giordano Bruno's contributions to astronomy. However, it diverges significantly by criticizing the materialistic and sense-based limitations of contemporary science. The text argues that true understanding comes from looking beyond the physical and sensory world, stating, \"what one might call the newer esotericism worked in a mysterious manner on Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler and others.\" This suggests that a deeper, spiritual insight influenced the development of modern science, a view that diverges from the purely empirical and materialistic approach of contemporary scientific methods.\n\nMoreover, modern esotericism diverges from both traditional Christian and scientific perspectives by emphasizing reincarnation and the evolution of the soul through various cosmic forces and spiritual beings' guidance. It discusses the intricate relationships between humans and cosmic forces, suggesting that individuals carry within them a cosmic imprint that influences their physical existence and spiritual evolution. This view introduces a more interconnected and cyclical understanding of life and the cosmos, which contrasts with the linear historical perspective of traditional Christianity and the material focus of contemporary science.\n\nIn summary, modern esotericism, as described in the text, builds upon traditional Christian and scientific perspectives by integrating them into a broader, spiritually oriented framework that emphasizes the cosmic significance of Christ, the role of spiritual beings in guiding humanity, and the importance of looking beyond the physical and sensory world to understand the cosmos and human evolution. It diverges from these perspectives by offering a more interconnected and spiritually focused view of existence, challenging the materialistic limitations of contemporary science, and expanding the Christian understanding of Christ's role in the cosmos.",

This evolution is depicted as a process that will lead humanity to a greater comprehension of spiritual truths and the cosmic significance of Christ, transcending previous understandings.\n\nThe text states that the beings who guided the old Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, who were not under the direction of Christ at that time, have since placed themselves under His guidance. Their progress consists in following Him in the higher worlds so that they may guide our current, fifth post-Atlantean period of civilization in accordance with His influence. This indicates a shift in the spiritual guidance of humanity towards a more Christ-centered approach, as these beings bring the Christ impulse into our spiritual evolution (e.g., \"Through the progress they make they are acquiring for themselves quite special capabilities, for they are qualifying themselves to receive the influx of forces emanating from the most important Being in the whole evolution of the Earth. The power of the Christ is working in them...\").\n\nFurthermore, the text suggests that in the future, humanity will be led to understand and experience the Christ principle in a new and profound way. This is illustrated by the expectation that in the twentieth century, individuals will begin to have spiritual experiences akin to that of St. Paul before Damascus, witnessing the Christ in a spiritual form. This signifies a broadening of spiritual perception among humanity, facilitated by the beings who have aligned themselves with Christ's guidance (e.g., \"It is in the twentieth century that those people will first appear who will have St. Paul’s experience of the Christ event in a spiritual way.\").\n\nAdditionally, the text implies that the spiritual guidance of humanity will continue to evolve through the work of these beings in teaching and spreading the Christ impulse. This includes the anticipation of a future where even scientific fields like chemistry and physics will be understood in a new, spiritual light, influenced by the Christ principle (e.g., \"And, strange as it may seem, there will be in the future, chemists and physicists who will not teach chemistry and physics as they are now taught under the influence of the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits; but who will teach that 'Matter is built up in the way in which the Christ gradually ordained it.'\").\n\nIn summary, the text suggests that the future spiritual guidance of humanity will evolve through a deeper integration of the Christ impulse, facilitated by beings who have placed themselves under Christ's leadership. This evolution is characterized by a shift towards a more profound understanding of Christ's cosmic role and influence, leading to a transformation in human consciousness and the way we perceive and interact with the spiritual and material worlds.",

And as the separate periods overlap, we see already in our times those early events preparing which will lead over into the sixth post-Atlantean epoch. And a seventh epoch will succeed the sixth in due course. On closer observation we find the following evidence with regard to the guidance of mankind. It was during the third epoch of civilization, the Egypto-Chaldæic, that the Angels (or lower dhyanic beings according to Oriental mysticism) were to some extent independent leaders of humanity. They were not so during the ancient Persian civilization. For then they were subject to a higher direction in a much greater degree than in the Egyptian times, and had to regulate everything in conformity with the impulses of the hierarchies immediately above them. In this way everything was under the immediate guidance of the Angels, but these themselves submitted to the rulership of the Archangels. And in the Indian epoch when post-Atlantean life had reached such a height in spiritual matters as has never been attained since a natural height under the direction of great human teachers then the Archangels themselves were subject in a similar sense to the guidance of the Archai or Primal Powers. Thus if we trace the evolution of humanity from the Indian epoch through the ancient Persian and Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, we may say that certain beings of the higher hierarchies withdrew as it were, ever more and more from the direct guidance of humanity. And in the fourth post-Atlantean period of civilization, i.e., the Graeco-Roman epoch, man had become in a certain sense quite independent. The guiding superhuman beings were certainly intervening to develop humanity, but only in such a way that the reins were tightened as little as possible, and also that the spiritual leaders themselves might profit as much through the deeds of men as men profited through them. Hence arose that peculiar and quite “human” civilization in the Graeco-Roman time in which man was made to rely entirely on himself. For all the distinctive characteristics of Art and political life in Greek and Roman times are traceable to the fact that man had to live out his own life in his own way.",

During the ancient Indian epoch, the Archangels were directly guiding humanity, but by the Graeco-Roman epoch, man had become more independent, and the guiding superhuman beings intervened in a way that allowed for more autonomy.

In the ancient Persian civilization, the Angels were subject to a higher direction to a greater degree than in Egyptian times, regulating everything in conformity with higher hierarchies. However, during the Egypto-Chaldæic civilization, the Angels were somewhat independent leaders of humanity, but still submitted to the rulership of the Archangels.

This independence allowed for a more human-centered civilization where individuals had to rely on themselves. This trend of increasing independence and self-reliance may continue in future epochs, leading to a scenario where humanity is guided in a way that allows for personal growth and development through their own actions.\n\nTherefore, the implication for future epochs beyond the current post-Atlantean epoch is that there may be a gradual shift towards even greater independence for humanity, where guidance from higher spiritual beings allows individuals to take more responsibility for their own evolution and development.",

Thus the progressive Angels are intervening to guide the fifth post-Atlantean civilization by means of capacities which they themselves had won during the third or Egypto-Chaldæic civilization. Through the progress they make they are acquiring for themselves quite special capabilities, for they are qualifying themselves to receive the influx of forces emanating from the most important Being in the whole evolution of the Earth. The power of the Christ is working in them; for that power works not only on the physical world through Jesus of Nazareth but also in the spiritual worlds upon the superhuman beings. The Christ exists not only for the earth but also for these other beings. The beings who guided the old Egypto-Chaldæic civilization were not at that time under the direction of the Christ, but have only placed themselves under His guidance since. And their progress consists in their following Him in the higher worlds, so that they may guide our fifth post-Atlantean period of civilization in accordance with His influence. And the remaining behind of those beings of whom it has been said that they operate as obstructive powers, is due to their not having put themselves under the leadership of the Christ, and thus they continue to work independently of Him. Hence the following state of things will become more and more evident in human evolution: There will be a materialistic movement under the guidance of the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits. It will have a materialistic character, and the greater part of what in all countries, may be called contemporary materialistic science is under this influence. There are, for example, people to-day who say that our earth in its primary origin consisted of atoms. Who instils this thought into men’s minds? It is the superhuman angel beings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic period. But, side by side with this movement, there is another making itself felt, the one which has as its goal that man shall eventually find in all that he does, that which may be called the Christ-principle.",

The progressive Angels guide humanity by utilizing qualities they acquired in primordial times and further developed through their work as leaders among the Egyptians and Chaldæans. This progress allows them to acquire special capabilities and qualify themselves to receive forces from the Christ. The power of the Christ not only works on the physical world through Jesus of Nazareth but also influences the superhuman beings guiding humanity. Those beings who guided the ancient Egypto-Chaldæic civilization have placed themselves under the guidance of the Christ, and their progress involves following Him in the higher worlds to guide the fifth post-Atlantean civilization in alignment with His influence. On the other hand, the obstructive Angels who remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic period continue to work independently of the Christ. This dichotomy leads to a materialistic movement influenced by the backward Egypto-Chaldæic spirits and a parallel movement aimed at integrating the Christ-principle into human endeavors. Thus, the guidance of the Angels plays a crucial role in shaping the spiritual direction of humanity, either towards materialism or towards embracing the Christ-principle in all aspects of life.",

And spirits of Personality the Primal Powers or Archai who guided humanity during the ancient Indian epoch will have to guide humanity in the seventh period of civilization. In the Graeco-Roman period, the Christ descended from the heights of the spirit-world and revealed Himself in the physical body of Jesus of Nazareth. He then came down as far as the physical world. It will be possible to find Him in the world immediately above ours when humanity shall have become sufficiently ripe. It will not be possible in the future to find Him in the physical world, but only in the world immediately above, for human beings will not always remain the same; they will become more mature, and will then find the Christ in the spiritual world, as Paul found Him in his experience before Damascus, which event prophetically foreshadowed the future means of finding the Christ. And since in our times the same great teachers who have already guided mankind through the Egyptian Civilization are working, so also in the twentieth century it will be these same teachers who will lead men out to behold the Christ as Paul beheld Him. They will show mankind how the Christ not only works upon the earth, but how He spiritualizes the whole solar system. And those who will be the reincarnated holy teachers of India in the seventh period of civilization will proclaim the Spirit Who was foreshadowed through the undivided Brahma, to whom however the right content and meaning could only be given through the Christ, as the great, the immense Spirit, of Whom they formerly said that He hovered above their sphere. Thus will humanity be led upwards from stage to stage into the spiritual world.\nTo speak in this way about the Christ how He is the leader of the higher hierarchies also in the successive worlds, is to teach the science which, under the title of modern esotericism, has endured into our civilization since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and which, as has been shown, had from that time become necessary.

He explains that in the current fifth period of civilization, Angels are instrumental in bringing the Christ into spiritual evolution. He then predicts that the sixth period will be guided by beings from the ranks of Archangels, who led the ancient Persian civilization. Following this, he mentions that spirits of Personality, the Archai, who guided humanity during the ancient Indian epoch, will lead in the seventh period. Steiner reflects on the Christ's descent during the Graeco-Roman period and suggests that in the future, humanity will find the Christ in the spiritual world rather than the physical realm, as individuals mature spiritually. He anticipates that the same great teachers who guided mankind through the Egyptian Civilization will lead humanity to encounter the Christ in the twentieth century, akin to Paul's experience before Damascus. Steiner emphasizes the spiritualization of the solar system by the Christ and the role of reincarnated holy teachers from India in the future civilization. He concludes by discussing modern esotericism's teachings on the Christ's leadership across different worlds, particularly after the Mystery of Golgotha.",

He lives a twofold life one in a physical body from birth to death, another in the spiritual worlds between death and a new birth. When he is incarnated in a physical body, he is living in dependence on the earth, because the physical body is restricted by the forces and conditions of existence belonging to the earth. A man, however, does not only take the substances and forces of the earth into himself, but is joined to the whole of the earth’s organism. When he has passed through the gate of death, he does not any longer belong to the forces of the earth; but it would be incorrect to imagine that he then belongs to no forces at all, for he is then connected with the forces of the solar system and the more distant star-systems. In this way, between death and a new birth, he lives in the domain of the cosmic, just as in the period between birth and death he lived in the domain of the earthly. From death to a new birth he belongs to the cosmos, as on the earth he belongs to the elements Air, Water, and Earth. Accordingly, while he is passing through a life between death and a new birth, he comes into the region of cosmic influences, for the planets send forth not merely the physical forces of what astronomy teaches, such as gravitation and others, but also spiritual forces, and with these spiritual powers of the cosmos man is connected each person in a special manner according to his own individuality. If he is born in Europe, he lives in a different relation to warmth conditions, etc., than if he had been born, let us say, in Australia. Similarly, during his life between death and a new birth, one person may stand more closely related to the spiritual powers of Mars, another to those of Jupiter, others again to those of the whole planetary system in general, and so on. It is also these forces which bring man back again to the earth. Thus before he is born he is living in connection with the collective whole of stellar space.",

It delves into how individuals are influenced by specific cosmic forces based on their individuality, mentioning that these forces guide man back to Earth before reincarnation. The paragraph underscores the intricate relationship between man and the cosmos, illustrating a profound connection that transcends earthly boundaries and extends into the vastness of the universe.",

He explains that between death and a new birth, man is connected with the forces of the solar system and more distant star-systems, living in the domain of the cosmic. Steiner states, \"In this way, between death and a new birth, he lives in the domain of the cosmic, just as in the period between birth and death he lived in the domain of the earthly.\" Additionally, he mentions that during this period, individuals are connected in a special manner to the spiritual powers of different planets, such as Mars or Jupiter, and the whole planetary system in general. This connection to cosmic forces continues even before a person is born, as they are living in connection with the collective whole of stellar space. Therefore, spiritual science recognizes Christ as a cosmic Being due to His connection with the spiritual forces of the cosmos that influence individuals both before and after their earthly life.",

However, after death, they transition to being connected with the forces of the solar system and even more distant star-systems. This transition signifies a shift from belonging to the earthly domain to being part of the cosmic realm. Steiner explains that between death and a new birth, individuals are influenced by the spiritual forces of the cosmos, which are not limited to physical forces like gravitation but also include spiritual powers specific to each person's individuality. This connection to cosmic influences is unique for each individual, just as their relationship to earthly conditions varies based on their place of birth. Therefore, man's life cycle involves a dynamic interplay between earthly and cosmic forces, with the planets playing a significant role in shaping these connections and guiding the individual's journey through different realms of existence.",

Therefore, the practical implication of this concept is that human beings are part of a larger cosmic framework that influences their existence and spiritual journey both on earth and in the spiritual realms.",

When a person was born, people said that in such and such a place he had “become young” (jung-geworden). Therein lies an unconscious reference to the fact that man in the time between death and a new birth continues at first to be subject to the powers which had made him old in a previous incarnation, but that before birth there come in their place such forces as again make him “young.” Thus Goethe in “Faust” still uses the expression “to become young in Nebelland” Nebelland being the old name for mediæval Germany.",

It is explained that a person's inclination to be born in a specific family, location, or time is determined by their pre-birth connection to cosmic forces. This idea is illustrated through a historical reference to the German-speaking region, where the expression of a person \"becoming young\" upon birth signifies the transition from being influenced by old cosmic forces between death and rebirth to being influenced by rejuvenating forces before birth. This transition is likened to Goethe's mention in \"Faust\" of becoming young in Nebelland, an old term for medieval Germany, symbolizing the renewal and rejuvenation that occurs before each new incarnation.",

This transition from old to young is influenced by the individual's connection to cosmic forces.

Thus is a man put into his place within physical existence, and it is in accordance with his horoscope that he guides himself before entering upon earthly existence. This subject, which in our times seems so much a thing of chance should not be touched upon without our attention being called to the fact that nearly everything practiced in this connection to-day is simply dilettantism a pure superstition and that for the external world the true science of these matters has been for the most part completely lost.

For instance, the positioning of celestial bodies like Mars over Aries in a horoscope influences the manifestation of certain forces related to Aries. This allocation within a horoscope plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's physical existence and guides their actions before entering earthly life.

We may now attempt to illustrate this hypothetically, but in a form corresponding entirely with clairvoyant observations: If a person’s physical brain were extracted and its construction clairvoyantly examined, so that it might be seen how certain parts are situated in certain places, and send out appendages, it would be found that the brain of each individual is different. No two people have brains alike. Then let us imagine further that this brain could be photographed in its complete structure so that one would have a kind of half-sphere in which every detail was visible, then this would make a different picture in the case of each person. And if one were to photograph a person’s brain at the moment of birth and then photograph also the heavens lying exactly over the person’s birthplace, then this latter picture would be of exactly the same appearance as that of the human brain.\nAs certain centres were arranged in the latter, so would the stars be in the photograph of the heavens. Man has within himself a picture of the heavens, and every man has a different one, according to whether he was born in this place or that, and at this or that time. This is one indication that man is born from out of the whole cosmos.\nWhen we keep this clearly in view we can rise to the idea of how the macrocosm manifests itself in each separate individual, and then, starting from this point, we can attain a conception of how it showed itself in the Christ. But if we were to imagine the Christ after the Baptism of John as though the macrocosm had then been living in Him in the same way as in other people, we should be mistaken.",

The text hypothetically suggests that if one were to photograph a person's brain at birth and the celestial configuration at that moment, the patterns would align, indicating a connection between an individual's brain structure and the positioning of stars at their birth. This concept illustrates how each person carries a unique reflection of the heavens within them, emphasizing the idea that humans are born from the entire cosmos.

Rudolf Steiner's text illustrates this by stating, \"Man has within himself a picture of the heavens, and every man has a different one, according to whether he was born in this place or that, and at this or that time.\" This perspective emphasizes the intricate connection between the individual and the cosmic forces shaping their existence, thereby challenging traditional views of individuality and highlighting a deeper cosmic interconnectedness.",

This connection is reflected in the unique structure of each person's brain, which mirrors the arrangement of the stars at the moment of their birth. This concept emphasizes the idea that man is born from the entire cosmos, highlighting the interplay between the individual and the universal.\n\nUnderstanding this connection allows one to grasp how the macrocosm manifests itself in each individual, leading to a deeper comprehension of how it manifested in the Christ. It distinguishes the Christ from other individuals, indicating that after the Baptism of John, the macrocosm did not live in Him in the same way as in other people. This insight underscores the uniqueness of the Christ's spiritual nature and cosmic significance, setting Him apart from ordinary human experiences of the macrocosm.\n\nIn summary, the perception of the macrocosm in each individual underscores the interconnectedness of humanity with the cosmos, offering insights into spiritual evolution and cosmic consciousness, particularly in understanding the exceptional nature of the Christ's relationship with the macrocosm.",

The one came through the Nathan line of the house of David, and the other through the Solomon line of the same house. These two children were not born quite at the same time, but nearly so. In the Jesus descended from Solomon, Who is described in the Gospel of St. Matthew, there was incarnated the same individuality who had formerly lived on the earth as Zarathustra, so that in this Child Jesus there appears the reincarnated Zarathustra or Zoroaster. The individuality of Zarathustra grew up in this Child until, as St. Matthew says, His twelfth year. In that year, Zarathustra left the body of this Child and passed over into that of the other Child Jesus Whom the Gospel of St. Luke describes. In consequence of this the latter child became suddenly quite different. The parents were astonished when they found Him in Jerusalem in the temple after the spirit of Zarathustra had entered into Him. This is intimated when it is said that the Child after having been lost and found again in the temple, so spake that his parents did not recognize Him. They only knew Him the Child descended from Nathan as He had been before up to this time. But when He began to reason with the doctors in the temple, it was possible for Him to speak as He did because the spirit of Zarathustra had come into Him. Until the thirtieth year did the spirit of Zarathustra live in the Jesus who was descended from the Nathan line of the house of David. In this body He ripened to a still higher perfection. The remark must here be added that as regards this personality in which the spirit of Zarathustra now lived, an extraordinary feature was, that from the spiritual worlds the Buddha rayed forth his impulses into its astral body.",

In the case of Jesus of Nazareth, it is revealed that the individuality of Zarathustra initially inhabited one of the two Jesus children, and later passed into the other Jesus child. This transition led to a transformation in the child, as indicated by the parents' astonishment when they found Him in the temple speaking differently after the spirit of Zarathustra had entered into Him. This intertwining of spiritual entities within the same physical body allowed for the development and expression of different spiritual influences and qualities. In the case of Jesus, the presence of Zarathustra's spirit in one child and later the Buddha's impulses in the other child contributed to the unique nature and spiritual evolution of Jesus of Nazareth. This intertwining demonstrates the complexity and depth of spiritual connections and influences that can manifest within an individual, shaping their character and mission in the world.",

The individuality of Zarathustra is said to have been reincarnated in the Child Jesus from the Solomon line. This narrative demonstrates the idea of spiritual entities inhabiting different bodies over time, showing a continuity of existence and purpose across lifetimes.\n\nFurthermore, the paragraph describes how Zarathustra's spirit left the first Child Jesus at the age of twelve and entered the other Child Jesus, leading to a significant transformation in the latter. This transition highlights the fluidity of spiritual presence and the potential for spiritual growth and evolution within a single lifetime.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of the Buddha radiating impulses into the astral body of the Jesus descended from the Nathan line adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, showing the interconnectedness of various spiritual beings and influences across different traditions and time periods.\n\nOverall, the narrative of the two Child Jesus figures serves to emphasize the continuity of spiritual entities, the potential for spiritual evolution and transformation, and the interplay of diverse spiritual influences throughout history.",

Now this sage was born again in the time of Jesus of Nazareth. It is he who is brought before us in the Gospel of St. Luke as the priest of the temple who saw the revelation of the Buddha in the Child Jesus descended from Nathan. And seeing this he was able to say: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace for I have seen my Master.” What he had not been able to see previously in India, he saw through the astral body of the Boy Jesus, Who comes before us in St. Luke’s Gospel, the Bodhisatva become a Buddha.",

This progression from 'Bodhisatva' to Buddha signifies a profound spiritual journey and transformation that the Buddha underwent, embodying the potential for spiritual growth and enlightenment for all individuals. Rudolf Steiner explains this concept by referencing the Indian sage Asita who recognized the future Buddha when he was a child and later saw the revelation of the Buddha in the Child Jesus descended from Nathan, illustrating the interconnectedness of spiritual beings and the recognition of spiritual evolution across different cultural and religious contexts.",

                    "text": "Thus in Palestine during the time that Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth as Christ-Jesus, during the three last years of his life, from his thirtieth to his thirty-third year, the entire Being of the cosmic Christ was acting uninterruptedly upon Him, and was working into Him. The Christ stood always under the influence of the entire cosmos He made no step without this working of the cosmic forces into and in Him. That which here took place in Jesus of Nazareth was a continual realization of the horoscope, for at every moment there occurred that which otherwise happens only at a person’s birth. This could be so only because the whole body of Jesus descended from Nathan had remained open to the influence of the sum total of the forces of the cosmic spiritual hierarchies which direct our earth. If thus the whole spirit of the cosmos worked into the Christ Jesus, who was it that went, for example, to Capernaum or anywhere else? He who went about as a being upon the earth appeared quite like any other man. The forces active within Him, however, were the cosmic forces, coming from the sun and stars; and these directed His body. And it was always in accordance with the collective Being of the whole Universe with whom the earth is in harmony, that all which the Christ Jesus did took place. It is because of this that in the case of the acts of the Christ Jesus there is so often some slight hint given in the Gospels, about the relative grouping of the stars at the time. We read in St. John’s Gospel how the Christ finds His first disciples. There we are told: “It was about the tenth hour,” because in this fact the spirit of the whole cosmos found expression in conformity with the appointed moment of time. Such intimations are less clear in the other Gospel passages, but he who can truly read the Gospel finds them everywhere. From this point of view also the miracles are to be judged. Let us take one passage, The one that runs thus: “When the sun was set, they brought the sick unto Him, and He healed them.” What does that mean? The evangelist is drawing attention to the fact that this healing was connected with the whole position of the constellations, and that at the time in question, the constellations throughout the heavens stood in such a way as could only have happened when the sun had set. The meaning of that, at the time, the requisite healing forces could make themselves felt after sun-set, and the Christ Jesus is represented as the intermediary Who brought the sick into connection with the forces of the cosmos which, just at that time could work curatively. These forces were the same as those which worked as Christ in Jesus. It was through the presence of Christ that the healing took place, because in consequence of the same, the sick person was exposed to the healing forces of the Cosmos which could only work as they did when they were in the right relationship to time and space. Thus these forces worked on the sick person through their representative the Christ. But it was only just during the time of Christ on earth that they could so work. It was only then that such a connection existed between the cosmic constellations and the powers of the human organism, that for certain illnesses, healing could intervene when through the instrumentality of the Christ Jesus, the cosmic grouping of the same forces was able to work on men. A repetition of this relationship in the evolution of the cosmos and the earth is as little possible as is a second incarnation of the Christ in a human body. Regarded in this way, the life of the Christ Jesus appears as the earthly expression of a definite connection between the cosmos and the forces of man. The tarrying of a sick person by the side of Christ means that through the proximity of Christ, this sick person found himself in such a relation with the macrocosm that the latter could work upon him curatively.",

The cosmic forces were constantly at work within Jesus, directing his actions and movements in alignment with the entire universe. This influence was akin to a constant realization of a horoscope, as if what typically occurs at birth was happening continuously in Jesus. The text emphasizes that Jesus, while appearing as an ordinary man externally, was guided by cosmic forces from the sun and stars, acting in harmony with the universe. The narrative highlights instances in the Gospels where subtle references to celestial alignments hint at the cosmic influence on Jesus' actions, including his healing miracles. The healing acts are portrayed as occurring at specific times when cosmic forces were aligned for curative effects, facilitated through Jesus as the conduit for these forces. This unique connection between cosmic constellations and healing powers was only possible during the presence of Christ on Earth, illustrating a profound interplay between the cosmos and human forces.",

Such intimations are less clear in the other Gospel passages, but he who can truly read the Gospel finds them everywhere.\" This deep connection to the cosmos allowed for a unique healing power to flow through Him, as \"for certain illnesses, healing could intervene when through the instrumentality of the Christ Jesus, the cosmic grouping of the same forces was able to work on men.\"",

The other forces, however, which had remained behind in the Egypto-Chaldæic times worked further side by side with those that are permeated by the Christ. This is evident even in the attitude frequently adopted to-day towards the Gospels. Literary works appear in which great pains are taken to show that the Gospels can be understood through an astrological interpretation. The greatest opponents of the Gospels employ this astrological interpretation in such a manner that, the way, for example, taken by the Archangel Gabriel from Elizabeth to Mary is supposed to signify nothing more than the progress of the sun from the constellation of Virgo to another. This, in a certain sense, is correct, except that these thoughts were poured in this manner into our age by the beings who had remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic Period. Under such an influence people are induced to a make-belief that the Gospels present only allegories in the place of definite cosmic relations. The truth really is, that in the Christ the whole cosmos finds expression and therefore one can express the life of the Christ by connecting its separate events with the cosmic relations which work into Earth existence unceasingly through the Christ. A right understanding of this matter will thus lead to a full recognition of the Christ, as having lived on earth, whereas the above mentioned error, if it were true, would mean that the Christ life in the Gospels is expressed by cosmic constellation and shows that it was only a matter of constellations being treated allegorically, and that there was no real earthly Christ at all.",

This approach reveals a deeper connection between the events in the life of Christ and the cosmic influences. On the other hand, opponents, influenced by beings who remained behind during the Egypto-Chaldæic Period, tend to interpret the Gospels purely from an astrological perspective. They see events like the Archangel Gabriel's journey as symbolic of astronomical movements, reducing the significance of the Christ's presence on Earth to mere allegory. This reveals that the influences from Egypto-Chaldæic times have led some to overlook the true spiritual essence of the Christ's life and teachings, replacing it with a superficial astrological interpretation that diminishes the reality of the earthly Christ.",

Let us suppose we were to trace with a pencil the outline of all that is shown from the surroundings. We could then take the mirror and carry the picture about with us wherever we went. Let this be a symbol for the fact that when a person is born, he brings with him a copy of the cosmos in himself, and afterwards carries about with him all through his life the effect of this one picture. The mirror might, however, be left untouched by the pencil, so that wherever the person carried it, it would depict the immediate surroundings. It then would always be giving a picture of the collective environment. This would be a symbol of the Christ from the baptism by St. John up to the mystery of Golgotha. That which, in the case of any other person, passes into his earthly existence at birth only flowed into the Christ-Jesus at every moment. And when the mystery of Golgotha was consummated, that which had been radiating from out the cosmos passed over into the spiritual substance of the earth, and has from that time forward been united with the spirit of the earth.\nWhen St. Paul became clairvoyant before Damascus, he could recognize that That which had formerly been in the cosmos has passed over into the spirit of the earth. Of this every one can be convinced who can bring his soul into such a condition that he can have the same experience as had St. Paul. It is in the twentieth century that those people will first appear who will have St. Paul’s experience of the Christ event in a spiritual way.",

The analogy of tracing the mirror's surroundings with a pencil symbolizes this idea. The text then transitions to likening the Christ's experience from baptism to Golgotha to a mirror constantly reflecting the collective environment, in contrast to the typical human experience. It highlights the unique continuous connection of the Christ with cosmic forces, culminating in the merging of cosmic radiations with the earth's spirit post-Golgotha. The passage concludes by mentioning St. Paul's clairvoyant experience near Damascus, where he recognized the transition of cosmic elements into the earth's spirit, suggesting that individuals in the twentieth century may have similar spiritual encounters with the Christ event.",

Before the mystery of Golgotha, the Christ was constantly receiving influences from the cosmos, unlike any other person who only receives such influences at birth. However, after the mystery of Golgotha was consummated, the Christ's connection with the cosmos passed over into the spiritual substance of the earth, becoming united with the spirit of the earth. This union signifies a shift in the Christ's relationship with the cosmic forces, now intertwined with the spirit of the earth. This transformation is highlighted in the paragraph: \"And when the mystery of Golgotha was consummated, that which had been radiating from out the cosmos passed over into the spiritual substance of the earth, and has from that time forward been united with the spirit of the earth.\"",

In the early times of post-Atlantean evolution men knew very well that above them there was not merely a physical Mars, but that what they saw as Mars, Jupiter or Saturn was the expression for a spiritual being. In later times this perception was completely forgotten. The heavenly bodies became, according to human ideas, mere bodies to be estimated according to their physical condition. And in the Middle Ages people saw in connection with the stars only what the eyes can see the sphere of Venus, the sphere of the Sun, the sphere of Mars, etc., up to the sphere of the fixed stars; and then came the eighth sphere like a solid blue wall behind. Then Copernicus appeared and broke down the idea that only that which is perceptible to the senses can be authoritative. The modern physical scientists may indeed say: “It is madness to declare that the world is Maya, or illusion, and that you must look into a spiritual world in order to see the truth, for in spite of all you say true science is that which relies on the senses and notifies what these senses tell.” But when did astronomers rely only on the senses? Surely at the very time when that astronomical science was dominant which is attacked by the science of to-day! It was at that time when Copernicus began to think out what exists in the cosmic space beyond the evidence of the senses, that our modern astronomy as a science began. And so it is in every domain of science. Everywhere that science, in the most modern sense of the word, has arisen, it has done so in opposition to what had been apparent to the senses. When Copernicus declared “what you see is Maya or deception, rely on what you cannot see,” then the science came into being which is recognized as such to-day. It might thus be said to the representative of modern science “your science itself only became ‘science’ when it was no longer willing to depend upon the senses only.”",

However, over time, this understanding faded, and these bodies were reduced to mere physical entities. During the Middle Ages, individuals viewed the stars solely through a physical lens, until Copernicus challenged this perspective by introducing the idea of looking beyond sensory perceptions. Steiner argues that true science emerges when one transcends the limitations of the senses, as exemplified by Copernicus's breakthrough in astronomy. He emphasizes that modern science evolved by moving beyond what is immediately visible, suggesting that relying solely on sensory data is not the essence of true scientific inquiry.",

But when did astronomers rely only on the senses? Surely at the very time when that astronomical science was dominant which is attacked by the science of to-day!\" This argument suggests that true science, particularly in the context of astronomy, began to evolve when scientists started to look beyond what was immediately perceptible to the senses, as exemplified by Copernicus's breakthrough in considering cosmic space beyond sensory evidence. The text implies that relying solely on the senses may limit scientific understanding and that true science often emerges when exploring realms beyond immediate sensory perception.",

In its place there came a mere sense-perception of the world. Then there came into evolution the Christ Impulse. Through this, mankind was led to stamp the spiritual view once more upon the materialistic. At that moment when Giordano Bruno burst the fetters of the sense illusion, the Christ evolution was so far advanced, that the soul power, which had been kindled by the Christ Impulse, could then be active within him. Therewith an indication is given of the whole significance of how the life of Christ penetrates all human evolution, an evolution only at the beginning of which humanity stands to-day.\nTo what then does spiritual science now aspire? It completes the work begun for external science by Giordano Bruno and others in that it says: that which external science is able to perceive is Maya, or illusion. Just as formerly one looked to the “eighth sphere” and thought that space was thereby bounded, so contemporary human thought believes that man is shut in or enclosed between birth and death. Spiritual science, however, expands man’s vision by directing his attention out and beyond the limits of birth and death.",

Those therefore who now stand, base their thought on foundations laid by Giordano Bruno and Copernicus and do not wish to accept theosophy, are unfaithful to their own traditions in desiring to hold fast by sense illusion. But spiritual science demonstrates that, as Giordano Bruno forced a way through the blue firmament of heaven, even so does this science break down the barriers of birth and death for man by showing how he originates from out of the macrocosm, lives in a physical existence, passes through death, and re-enters macrocosmic life. And what we see in a limited degree in each individual meets us unrestrictedly and in a larger sense in the representative of the spirit of the cosmos in the Christ-Jesus. Once and once only could that impulse be given which the Christ gave. Once only could the whole cosmos be thus reflected, for the conjunction of the stars which then took place can never be repeated. In order to give an impulse to the earth, this conjunction was obliged to work through a human body. As it is true that this same grouping cannot occur a second time, so it is equally true that the Christ was only once incarnated. Only if one did not know that the Christ is the representative of the whole universe and only if it were impossible to win one’s way to this Christ-Idea, the elements for which are given through spiritual science only then would it be possible to maintain that Christ could appear more than once upon the earth.",

Their work in breaking down the barriers of the physical world and perceiving the cosmos as more than what is perceptible to the senses paved the way for modern spiritual science. The paragraph states, \"What one might call the newer esotericism worked in a mysterious manner on Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler and others... But spiritual science demonstrates that, as Giordano Bruno forced a way through the blue firmament of heaven, even so does this science break down the barriers of birth and death for man by showing how he originates from out of the macrocosm, lives in a physical existence, passes through death, and re-enters macrocosmic life.\" Furthermore, it emphasizes that those who base their thoughts on the foundations laid by Giordano Bruno and Copernicus and reject theosophy are being unfaithful to their own traditions. The paragraph concludes by highlighting the uniqueness of the Christ's incarnation, indicating that the Christ's impulse could only be given once and that the Christ was only incarnated once, aligning with the idea that the Christ represents the whole universe and that this understanding is facilitated through spiritual science.",

Asita came to the royal palace of the Buddha's father when the Buddha was a child and wept because he knew the child would become the Buddha but would not live to see it. This indicates his deep connection to the Buddha's future enlightenment. Additionally, Asita was reborn during the time of Jesus of Nazareth and recognized the revelation of the Buddha in the Child Jesus descended from Nathan. This is depicted in the Gospel of St. Luke where Asita, as the priest of the temple, saw the connection between the Buddha and the Child Jesus, stating, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace for I have seen my Master.” Through his spiritual insight, Asita was able to perceive the Bodhisatva become a Buddha in the Child Jesus, showcasing his role in recognizing spiritual truths across different incarnations.",

He broke down the idea that only the physical world perceived by the senses was authoritative and emphasized looking into a spiritual world to see the truth. Bruno led people to recognize that the boundaries perceived in space were not limitations but illusions, and he revealed that an infinite number of worlds existed in cosmic space. By doing so, Bruno encouraged humanity to see beyond the limitations of the sense-world and to recognize the concept of Infinity. This expansion of perception was significant as it marked a shift from a mere sense-perception of the world to a spiritual view once more, influenced by the Christ Impulse that was active within him. Bruno's philosophical interpretations of the teachings of Copernicus paved the way for a deeper understanding of the cosmos and human existence beyond what was immediately perceptible to the senses.",

This renewal of spiritual views is exemplified by the work of Giordano Bruno and others who broke through the limitations of materialistic perceptions and expanded human consciousness to recognize the spiritual dimensions of existence. The text states, \"Through this, mankind was led to stamp the spiritual view once more upon the materialistic,\" highlighting how the Christ Impulse influenced a shift in human consciousness towards a deeper understanding of the spiritual aspects of life and existence. This renewal of spiritual views is further emphasized by the role of spiritual science, or theosophy, in expanding human awareness beyond the confines of birth and death, guiding individuals to perceive their connection with the macrocosm and the spiritual forces at play in the universe.",

External science relies on what is perceptible to the senses and considers man to be enclosed between birth and death. In contrast, spiritual science reveals a broader perspective by directing attention beyond these limits. It acknowledges the continuous chain in human evolution and aims to show how man originates from the macrocosm, lives in a physical existence, passes through death, and re-enters macrocosmic life. This expansion of vision is achieved through clairaudience and clairvoyance, enabling individuals to perceive the spirit world and the guidance of superhuman beings who are now under the Christ. This new inspiration, prepared by esoteric teachers from the middle ages onwards, emphasizes the connection between man and the whole macrocosm, providing a deeper understanding of the Christ and the spiritual forces at play.",

That which is appearing as the new esotericism will flow slowly into the hearts of men, and the spiritual guidance of men and of humanity will ever more and more be consciously seen in such a light. We realize to ourselves how at first the Christ-principle flowed into the hearts of men because the Christ had gone about Palestine in the physical body of Jesus of Nazareth. Later men gradually surrendered themselves entirely to a reliance on the world of sense, and could only receive the impulse which corresponded to their perception. Afterwards that same impulse so worked through the inspiration of the new esotericism that such spirits as Nicholas Cusamus, Copernicus and Galileo were able to be inspired and Copernicus, for instance, was enabled to make this assertion: “That which is evident to the senses cannot teach the truth about the solar system; if we want to find the truth we must investigate behind sense appearances.” At that time men, even spirits like Giordano Bruno, were not yet ripe enough to join consciously to the new esoteric stream. The spirit of the movement had to work in them unconsciously. Yet powerful and magnificent was the announcement of Giordano Bruno: “When a human being enters into existence by means of birth, then it is something macrocosmic that concentrates itself as a monad; and when a human being passes through death the monad spreads itself out again; that which was enclosed within the body spreads itself out in the cosmos in order to draw itself together again in other stages of existence, and again to spread itself out.” There Bruno gave expression to mighty conceptions which, even if expressed in stammering tongue, were yet in entire accord with the sense of the new esotericism.",

The text traces the historical progression from the initial influence of the Christ-principle during Jesus of Nazareth's time to a subsequent reliance on the material world. It then describes how this impulse manifested through figures like Nicholas Cusamus, Copernicus, and Galileo, who delved beyond sensory perceptions to uncover deeper truths. The paragraph also touches on Giordano Bruno's profound insights into human existence, emphasizing the macrocosmic nature of birth, death, and reincarnation. Bruno's ideas, though not fully aligned with the emerging esoteric stream, resonated with its essence, showcasing a profound understanding of cosmic interconnectedness and spiritual evolution.",

Thousands had seen the old church lamp there, but they have not seen it as did Galileo. He saw the church lamp swinging; compared the time of its oscillation with the beat of his own pulse; found that the church lamp swung in a regular rhythm resembling his pulse-beat; and from this discovered the laws of the pendulum in the sense of modern physics. Anyone acquainted with contemporary physics knows that these would not be possible without Galileo’s principle. In this way the force was then working which is now appearing as spiritual science; Galileo was placed in the cathedral of Pisa before the oscillating church lamp, and modern physics gained its principles. In such a mysterious way do the guiding spiritual forces of humanity perform their work.",

Galileo's observation of the oscillating church lamp in the cathedral of Pisa led him to discover the laws of the pendulum, a foundational principle in modern physics. Similarly, the emergence of spiritual science is attributed to spiritual influences working in a similar mysterious manner. Just as Galileo was placed in a specific setting that led to a significant discovery, the text suggests that spiritual forces guide individuals like Copernicus, Bruno, and others towards insights that challenge conventional perceptions and lead to the development of spiritual knowledge. This connection highlights the subtle yet profound ways in which spiritual guidance shapes human understanding and discovery throughout history.",

Galileo's experience in the cathedral of Pisa, where he observed the oscillating church lamp and made a scientific discovery, is presented as an example of how spiritual forces work behind the scenes to influence human progress. This indicates that there is a deeper spiritual guidance at play in significant human endeavors.\n\n2. **Unconscious Influence**: Galileo's observation and subsequent discovery of the laws of the pendulum were influenced by spiritual forces in a subtle and unconscious manner. While thousands had seen the church lamp before him, it was Galileo who perceived it in a unique way that led to a scientific breakthrough. This suggests that spiritual guidance can operate subtly and indirectly, impacting individuals in ways they may not fully comprehend at the time.\n\n3. **Connection between Spiritual Science and Scientific Discoveries**: The text implies a connection between the spiritual forces at work in guiding humanity and the advancements in scientific knowledge. It suggests that the force behind Galileo's experience in the cathedral of Pisa, which led to the principles of modern physics, is now manifesting as spiritual science. This indicates a continuity between spiritual insights and scientific progress, emphasizing the intertwined nature of spiritual guidance and intellectual development.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of Galileo in the cathedral of Pisa illustrates how spiritual influences can shape scientific discoveries and progress, even when individuals may not be consciously aware of the spiritual forces at play.",

It mentions that humanity started from an \"originally spiritual view of the cosmos\" but gradually lost it, leading to a mere sense-perception of the world. However, with the Christ Impulse entering evolution, mankind was guided to reintegrate the spiritual view into the materialistic. This process is exemplified by figures like Giordano Bruno breaking down the barriers of sense illusion and expanding human vision to recognize the infinite nature of the cosmos. The text also emphasizes the role of spiritual science in expanding human consciousness beyond the limits of birth and death, enabling individuals to perceive the spiritual world clairvoyantly and clairaudiently. Ultimately, it suggests that as humanity progresses, there will be a heightened awareness of spiritual forces at work and a deeper understanding of the spiritual world's significance in human evolution.",
