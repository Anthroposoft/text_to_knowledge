    "text": "Martin Luther\n\nCarl E. Koppenhaver\n\n1953, by Muhlenberg Press\n\n\n\n= THE MINER'S SON\n\n\n\n== Eisleben to Erfurt\n\n\n\nThe Turk was slashing his way up the valley of the Danube into the heart\n\nof Europe. God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful\n\nlaw-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest\n\nlurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.\n\n\n\nInto such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by\n\nsuperstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben,\n\nGermany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm,\n\nconvinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a\n\nChristian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth\n\nwas lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the\n\nimpact of his life.\n\n\n\nThe Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning\n\nafter his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His\n\nparents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They\n\nhad moved recently from the farming community of MÃ¶hra, home of the\n\nLuther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the\n\ncopper mines.\n\n\n\nWhen Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by\n\nMansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty\n\nthat Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time\n\nMartin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a\n\nschool conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was\n\nthe custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door\n\nwith one of the school choirs.\n\n\n\nHe stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish\n\nschool of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by\n\nsinging and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a\n\nwoman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar\n\ninto her home.\n\n\n\nHans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was\n\nseventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of\n\nErfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had\n\npassed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.\n\n\n\n== Into the Cloister\n\n\n\nObedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began\n\nhis post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field\n\nof law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the\n\nwhole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian\n\nmonastery.\n\n\n\nHans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were\n\nastounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but\n\nin the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in\n\nthe words \"religious experience.\"\n\n\n\nHis parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early\n\ninfluence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and\n\nthe last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle\n\nages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was\n\ntremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He\n\nattended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school.\n\nHis introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and\n\nshortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness\n\nand heaven.\n\n\n\nSeveral grim incidents increased his anxiety. While on a holiday from\n\nthe university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his\n\nstudent sword. He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the\n\nVirgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague\n\nmoved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to\n\nMansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning\n\nstruck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he\n\ninvoked St. Anna for aid and vowed \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\"\n\nFifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of\n\nthe \"Black Cloister,\" monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in\n\nErfurt.\n\n\n\nThat this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and\n\nthat his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of\n\na monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university,\n\nlater proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.\n\n\n\n== Monk and Priest\n\n\n\nLuther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain\n\nfor several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being\n\nexamined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was\n\nshaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl,\n\nand formally received as a novice.\n\n\n\nHe scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various\n\nascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended\n\nLuther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was\n\nreceived into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and\n\nscholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for\n\nthe priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.\n\n\n\nThe petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's\n\nenergy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic\n\ntheology available at that time. However, long hours with books did\n\nlittle to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought\n\nwithin the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own\n\nefforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that\n\nhis penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to\n\ncompensate for his sins.\n\n\n\nAlthough his heart was not at rest, Luther continued to perform his\n\npriestly duties and undertake any new tasks assigned to him. In the fall\n\nof 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been\n\nentrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established\n\nUniversity of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic\n\nand ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a\n\nbachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of\n\nthe Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called\n\nback to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for\n\nabout a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another\n\nmonk on a mission to Rome.\n\n\n\nIn the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible.\n\nHis high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of\n\nits reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church\n\nremained unshaken.\n\n\n\n= THE PROFESSOR\n\n\n\n== Dr. Luther\n\n\n\nLuther returned to Erfurt from Rome, and in the summer of 1511 was sent\n\nas one of three new professors to Wittenberg. Here he came under the\n\ninfluence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who\n\nshowed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.\n\n\n\nAs yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy,\n\nand forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but\n\nhe never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried\n\nthe path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than\n\ncould be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.\n\n\n\nLuther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined\n\nstages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series\n\nof crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave\n\nperiods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved\n\nand sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through\n\nhis own works.\n\n\n\nStaupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's\n\nweakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was\n\nno striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual found peace\n\nin a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts\n\nwere virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with\n\nself-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way\n\nof Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a\n\nGod whom he conceived to be an angry judge.\n\n\n\nLuther's troubled spirit did not lower him in the vicar's estimation\n\nand, perhaps to get his mind off it, Staupitz advised him to study for a\n\ndoctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university. It was\n\ngood medicine, for thus the distressed monk came to closer grips with\n\nthe source book of his faith. So far, writings about the Bible, rather\n\nthan the book itself, had been his main diet. He studied for the degree\n\nand preached in the monastery's rickety chapel until October 18-19,\n\n1512, when he became Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture,\n\nprofessor of Bible at Wittenberg University.\n\n\n\n== The Awakening\n\n\n\nSince May, 1512, Luther had been subprior and regent in the school\n\nconnected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg. In May, 1515, he became\n\ndistrict vicar for Thuringia and Meissen, having eleven monasteries\n\nunder his care. Meanwhile he was discharging his duties as professor in\n\nthe university.\n\n\n\nFrequently the solution to great problems comes quite undramatically as\n\none goes about the daily tasks. Luther's awakening to a God who makes\n\nman righteous in order to save him came in such a way. He knew the\n\nteaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked\n\nhimself, is righteous?\n\n\n\nAs he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries,\n\nhe gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that\n\ngrace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New\n\nTestament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not\n\nmake himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man\n\nrighteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this\n\ncame the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\n\n\nAt this point Luther still felt that he was in total agreement with the\n\nteachings of the Roman Church. In a humble way he believed that he had\n\ndiscovered for himself what always had been--that he had just been slow\n\nin catching on. Deeper study, however, made it clear to him that there\n\nwas a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle\n\nages. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his\n\nsalvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed\n\nhim and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.\n\nThis indeed was not the work of an implacable judge, but of a loving\n\nFather.\n\n\n\nLuther now found himself rejecting most of the medieval writers and\n\nteachers. He went back to the Bible, to Christ, and the apostles.\n\nConvinced of the truth, he no longer was restrained by contradictory\n\nviews. His beliefs were contrary to many of the teachings of the church,\n\nand while he didn't plan it that way they brought him into open revolt.\n\nThe matter of indulgences opened the battle.\n\n\n\n= COLLISION WITH ROME\n\n\n\n== The Question of Indulgences\n\n\n\nThe Roman Church taught that forgiveness of sins could be secured only\n\nthrough the sacrament of penance. This required contrition of heart,\n\nconfession to a priest, and satisfaction by good works. Release from the\n\npenalty of eternal punishment was guaranteed by the absolution\n\npronounced by the priest. If not enough works of penance were done\n\nbefore death, however, the remainder had to be atoned for in the\n\ntorments of purgatory for an indefinite period.\n\n\n\nGradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences\n\nto offset purgatorial punishment. It was at this point that Luther's\n\ntheology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift,\n\nbut indulgences implied that man can earn grace.\n\n\n\nIn 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric\n\nof Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg.\n\nBecause of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable\n\ninvestment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to\n\nbe a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before\n\nnegotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to\n\noverlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which\n\nhe needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.\n\n\n\nAlbert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg.\n\nThen the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that\n\nhe could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise\n\nadditional sums for St. Peter's.\n\n\n\nJohn Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in\n\nselling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's\n\nparish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence\n\ntraffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered\n\nfor veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of\n\nLuther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel.\n\nLuther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk\n\ncountered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him\n\nindulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard\n\non the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to\n\nRome.\n\n\n\n== The Ninety-five Theses\n\n\n\nThe theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration\n\nof revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to\n\ntheologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence\n\nsituation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the\n\nninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.\n\n\n\nThe points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but\n\nmerely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther\n\nmaintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong\n\nexperience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome\n\nsinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties\n\nwhich the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the\n\ndeparted and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.\n\n\n\nLuther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by\n\nattempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he\n\nthought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the\n\ntheses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were\n\napplauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they\n\nwere distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.\n\n\n\nThere had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the\n\npope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own\n\nnational affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for\n\nthose who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but\n\nalso for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power.\n\nEven though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector\n\nFrederick stood by his daring young monk.\n\n\n\nAs the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the\n\ncause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to\n\nenable him to publish some theses of his own.\n\n\n\nWhen the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students\n\nat Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire.\n\nLuther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased\n\nby their sophomoric act.\n\n\n\n== Rome Moves to Attack\n\n\n\nLuther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded\n\nthem to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a\n\nrow between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther\n\nwith heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther\n\nreceived notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.\n\n\n\nBy no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim\n\nof a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector\n\nFrederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at\n\nleast have the benefit of impartial judges.\n\n\n\nOn second thought the pope decided not to wait sixty days and ordered\n\nthe elector to arrest Luther at once and turn him over to Cardinal\n\nCajetan for delivery in Rome. Although Frederick was not sympathetic to\n\nheresy he was determined that the man who had brought so much attention\n\nto his university at Wittenberg should have fair play. He prevailed upon\n\nthe pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in\n\nAugsburg where he would be attending a diet or parliament.\n\n\n\nIn a benign manner the cardinal offered to help Luther out of all his\n\ndifficulty if he would simply submit to the pope's authority and retract\n\nhis errors. Luther of course refused and tried to defend his positions.\n\nA fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of\n\nthree days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return\n\nuntil he was ready to recant.\n\n\n\nThe cardinal was quite upset by the Augsburg incident and wrote Elector\n\nFrederick a letter calling upon him to turn the heretical monk over to\n\nthe Roman authorities. Frederick's reply indicated his increasing\n\nresistance to papal dictatorship. He asked for a free trial and a\n\nstatement of Luther's errors in writing.\n\n\n\nThe pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, was dispatched to Germany in\n\nan attempt to rectify Cajetan's blundering. He correctly estimated that\n\nmuch of the populace was on Luther's side and the time for forcibly\n\nsuppressing him was past. Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to\n\nhave his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further\n\nattack in the meantime. Luther agreed, but only on the condition that\n\nhis opponents would remain silent too.\n\n\n\n= THE BREACH WIDENS\n\n\n\n== Pushed into the Arena\n\n\n\nEven while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up\n\nwhich drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to\n\nrecant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the\n\nUniversity of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a\n\ndisputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with\n\nRome.\n\n\n\nAndrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of\n\nLuther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck\n\nthrough the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was\n\narranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve\n\ntheses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with\n\nthe theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was\n\nbaiting Luther into the arena.\n\n\n\nAfter months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and\n\nwith much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519.\n\nSeveral hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort\n\nof college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate\n\nthey frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students\n\nwho sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over\n\nthe relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness\n\nof Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but\n\nspectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take\n\nthe field.\n\n\n\nFor another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the\n\npope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government\n\nwas a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church\n\nwas a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew\n\nconcerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted\n\nby Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he\n\nalso was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been\n\nestablished by Christ.\n\n\n\nLuther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's\n\nprevious statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said,\n\nis the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.\n\n\n\n== The Shadow of Hus\n\n\n\nThe crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical\n\ncorner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps\n\nif he made him synonymous with heresy....\n\n\n\nCraftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and\n\nthose of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance\n\nhad condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the\n\ninsinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.\n\n\n\nIt was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy\n\nthat Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers.\n\nThe condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his\n\nviews heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were\n\ngenuinely Christian and evangelical.\n\n\n\nThe spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther\n\nshocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean\n\nthat the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not\n\nbeyond fault. This was heresy.\n\n\n\nLuther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his\n\nideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human\n\nweakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake\n\nof good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make\n\nhim infallible. After all, he was human.\n\n\n\nNow this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that\n\ncouncils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably\n\nwas the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that\n\neven general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his\n\nstand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\n\n\n\nResults of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris\n\nwho condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip\n\nMelanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther,\n\nquestioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked\n\ndown their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the\n\nfew to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.\n\n\n\n== For Such a Time as This\n\n\n\nLuther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had\n\nhoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church\n\neffected.\n\n\n\nThe controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The\n\npope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its\n\ndecisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the\n\nChurch of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the\n\ncommunity of believers throughout the world.\n\n\n\nGradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from\n\nthose of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The\n\nnotion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't\n\ncause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from\n\nit and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts,\n\nsermons, and commentaries.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Leipzig debate, the summer of 1519 brought forth\n\nanother event which was significant in Luther's life. Maximilian, the\n\nHoly Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was\n\nof utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently,\n\nthere was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named\n\nCharles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a\n\nHapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a\n\nstrong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish\n\nmother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an\n\noutlying province of Spain.\n\n\n\nWide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well\n\nas prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes\n\nof many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role\n\nof national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few\n\nunderstood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead\n\nthem to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars,\n\nprinces, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor\n\nwho had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually\n\nLuther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called\n\nit the Reformation.\n\n\n\n= LUTHER EXPLAINS HIMSELF\n\n\n\n== The Christian Nobility\n\n\n\nLuther's attempts to interest the pope in reform had proved futile. He\n\nwas likewise unsuccessful in having a general council convened to\n\nconsider his propositions. Now, in the first of three great treatises,\n\nhe called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state\n\nof the church.\n\n\n\nAppearing in August, 1520, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of\n\nthe German Nation\" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and\n\nprodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians\n\nare priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and\n\nparticularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct\n\nof the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice\n\nand wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or\n\nin the monastery.\n\n\n\nNo one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists\n\nbecause they have erected three walls of defense, \"_First_, when pressed\n\nby the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal\n\npower has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made\n\nto reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the\n\ninterpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope.\n\n_Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that\n\nno one can call a council but the pope.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLuther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal\n\nbefore God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior\n\nto other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also\n\na cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of \"priest\" is conferred\n\nby laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the\n\nholder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.\n\n\n\nHe breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened\n\nChristian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him\n\nin the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence\n\nthat every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management\n\nin the church.\n\n\n\n== The Babylonian Captivity\n\n\n\nBefore his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his\n\nsecond treatise, \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.\" The first had\n\nbeen primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It\n\naimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the\n\n\"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system.\n\n\n\nThe Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace\n\nassociated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be\n\nperformed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church\n\ncontrolled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its\n\nmost vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer\n\nbind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest\n\nartillery.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should\n\nbe servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants\n\nof a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free\n\ngift to the individual believer.\n\n\n\nIn the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only\n\ntwo sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as\n\ntaught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted\n\nby Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make\n\nuse of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation,\n\nordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as\n\nsacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.\n\n\n\nThe mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and\n\ncrucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice\n\nman tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of\n\nthe believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine\n\nshould be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is\n\nreally present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the\n\nwine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover,\n\nChrist is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His\n\nsacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's\n\nsins are remitted if he has faith.\n\n\n\n== Christian Liberty\n\n\n\nMiltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther\n\nand the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write\n\na letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his\n\nattacks on the papacy.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his\n\nadvisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who\n\nmake him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, \"for through\n\nthem Satan already has made much headway.\" He also assured Leo that he\n\nwas an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing\n\nagainst him personally.\n\n\n\nAccompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, \"A\n\nTreatise on Christian Liberty.\" It expresses calm Christian reflection\n\nquite different from the theological conflicts which were carried\n\nforward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions\n\nwhich seem to be a paradox: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of\n\nall, subject to none,\" and \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful\n\nservant of all, subject to all.\"\n\n\n\nThe first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been\n\nliberated and restored to a right relationship with God through\n\njustifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the\n\nconsequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.\n\n\n\nThis freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the\n\nconsequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates,\n\npassions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own\n\npersonal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to\n\nnone.\"\n\n\n\nThe second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a\n\ndifferent direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now\n\nthe reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his\n\nneighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a\n\nsincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no\n\nless than become the servant of all.\n\n\n\nThe treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months\n\npreviously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.\n\n\n\n== The Papal Bull\n\n\n\nA chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those\n\nconcerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It\n\nreached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery\n\nepistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized.\n\nAware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was\n\nbeing burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly\n\nletter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian\n\nliberty.\n\n\n\nOn the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to\n\nprove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies,\n\nhe never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather\n\nthan individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this\n\ninstance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where\n\nindividual freedom before God was essential.\n\n\n\nThe papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the\n\nburning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and\n\nwarned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication.\n\nDistribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome\n\nAleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books\n\nin several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to\n\nstrenuous opposition by the German people.\n\n\n\nOn December 10, probably in reprisal for a book-burning at Cologne,\n\nMelanchthon posted a notice on the Wittenberg University bulletin board\n\ninviting students and faculty to a bonfire outside the Elster gate of\n\nthe city. Books on scholastic theology, and especially those works of\n\ncanon law on which the pope and the Roman hierarchy based their claims\n\nto power, were tossed into the flames. Then Luther stepped forward\n\nquietly and with a prayer on his lips added the booklet containing the\n\npapal bull to the fire. He and the professors withdrew but the students\n\nmade a holiday of the affair, parading and singing throughout the town\n\nand burning books of Luther's opponents.\n\n\n\nSignificantly, the bonfire marked the end of the sixty-day period of\n\ngrace. From now on no one was to communicate with Luther or provide him\n\nwith the necessities of life. In the eyes of Rome he was an outlaw.\n\n\n\n= THE MONK STANDS FIRM\n\n\n\n== The Diet of Worms\n\n\n\nOvertones of intrigue and statecraft are dominant in the prelude to the\n\nimperial assembly at Worms. The church at Rome had given its decision.\n\nWould the secular authorities now take action and turn him over to the\n\npapal authorities?\n\n\n\nCharles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial\n\nconstitution which said no German should be taken outside his country\n\nfor trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing.\n\nFrederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using\n\nthese same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative,\n\nwanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well\n\naware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man\n\nhad been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the\n\nrulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further\n\nexamination of his views.\n\n\n\nFor the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to\n\ntransacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed\n\nhis mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing.\n\nFinally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct\n\nto Worms.\n\n\n\nIn a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from\n\nWittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him\n\nto preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms.\n\nWhen the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on\n\nApril 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the\n\ncity gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther\n\nwas barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St.\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\nHe was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and\n\nbecause of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and\n\nalleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door\n\nof the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of\n\nprinces, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On\n\nit sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table\n\nloaded with books.\n\n\n\n== Answer Without Horns\n\n\n\nAfter the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer,\n\nan official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked\n\nLuther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had\n\nwritten.\n\n\n\nLuther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions\n\nand was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could\n\nnot be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that\n\nthe titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.\n\n\n\nAgain the question, \"Will you retract...?\"\n\n\n\nThe monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's\n\nWord. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever\n\nshall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\"\n\nSince salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The\n\ndiet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.\n\n\n\nAfter a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive\n\nassembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the\n\ntremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but\n\nthis time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or\n\nare you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had\n\nbeen seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it.\n\nThey were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was\n\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nThe books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely\n\ndevotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was\n\nagainst the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to\n\nfurther tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against\n\nindividuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and\n\nintemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the\n\nScriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the\n\nfires.\n\n\n\nObviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the\n\nBible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther.\n\n\"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not\n\nrecant your errors?\"\n\n\n\n== Neither Right nor Safe\n\n\n\nThe Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely\n\nlittle figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy\n\nRoman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.\n\n\n\n\"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will\n\nanswer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.\n\n\n\nThe spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the\n\nearnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to\n\nall corners of the room.\n\n\n\n\"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I\n\ntrust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred\n\nand contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by\n\nthe Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will\n\nrecant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against\n\nconscience. God help me! Amen.\"\n\n\n\nThere was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The\n\ninterrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the\n\nmeeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring\n\npopulace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the\n\ncourageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning\n\nnotices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.\n\n\n\nCharles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide\n\nwhat should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was\n\nrestrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other\n\nmeasures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select\n\ngroup of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a\n\nreconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down\n\nwhen Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.\n\n\n\nHaving received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for\n\nWittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the\n\nnext day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor\n\nsigned the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself\n\nin a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the\n\nemperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.\n\n\n\n= DRASTIC CHANGES\n\n\n\n== Wartburg to Wittenberg\n\n\n\nFortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the\n\npeople. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be\n\nin tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a\n\n\"kidnapping\" and removal to a safe place was planned.\n\n\n\nLuther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit\n\nrelatives at MÃ¶hra. For months the outside world knew only that he had\n\nbeen captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights.\n\nMany lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to\n\nhis adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed\n\ntheir fears.\n\n\n\nBy a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an\n\nancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the\n\nexception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did\n\nnot leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George,\n\na carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side.\n\nThe secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who\n\nauthorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.\n\n\n\nLuther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to\n\ncontemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and\n\nearlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel?\n\nCould a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error\n\nand drag many others to eternal damnation?\n\n\n\n\n\nHard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the\n\nWartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a\n\nwork on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the\n\nMagnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well\n\nunderway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.\n\n\n\nPrayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain\n\nsilent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With\n\nconviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him\n\nback into the world again he went courageously and with determination.\n\nHe was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what\n\ntook him back to Wittenberg.\n\n\n\n== From Freedom to License\n\n\n\nSo often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was\n\nno exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from\n\nbondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly\n\nprocedure.\n\n\n\nIn parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs,\n\npaintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were\n\ndiscarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests\n\nmarried, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms\n\nof the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in\n\nthe traditional forms were attacked.\n\n\n\nRumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise\n\nof Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December,\n\n1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which\n\nthey later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a \"warning\n\nagainst riot and rebellion,\" written on his return to the Wartburg.\n\n\n\nIn it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of\n\nfaith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart\n\nof a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in\n\nGod--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works.\n\nGiving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as\n\nthe spiritual attitude of the communicant.\n\n\n\nFinally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step\n\nin, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522.\n\nInsisting that no drastic change should be made until, through\n\nre-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he\n\nrestored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.\n\n\n\nThe peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of\n\nbloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they\n\nadapted Luther's \"free lord of all\" statement to their own demands for\n\nsocial reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to\n\nlawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally\n\ndefeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.\n\n\n\n== Pigtails on the Pillow\n\n\n\nWittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian\n\nnunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the\n\nlocal university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the\n\nBlack Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were\n\nArtist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle\n\nChurch; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....\n\n\n\nIf there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been\n\nannounced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to\n\nappear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and\n\nslanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The\n\nmalicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with\n\na special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister,\n\nand a dance at the town hall on June 27.\n\n\n\nThe wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He\n\ndisliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before\n\nGod through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace.\n\nCelibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but\n\nmarriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and\n\nconvents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at\n\nthe age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.\n\n\n\nShe and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan\n\nof escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him\n\npersonally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in\n\nempty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded\n\nand some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes,\n\nhusbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not\n\npermanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking.\n\nThen the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself\n\nwould be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which\n\nhe had urged on so many others.\n\n\n\nIt was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I\n\nwas alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair\n\nof pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\n\n\n\n== The Cloister Becomes a Home\n\n\n\nMarriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years.\n\nPreviously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the\n\nBlack Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made\n\nin over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot\n\nhis meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.\n\n\n\nThe vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be\n\nimagined by his reference to her as \"my lord Kathie.\" She was an\n\nefficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed\n\nat the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his\n\nwriting, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax\n\nrevenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.\n\n\n\nThings improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home,\n\nand adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where\n\nKathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was\n\naugmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the\n\nuniversity.\n\n\n\nThe Luthers had six children. Two of them died in childhood, but\n\notherwise the family enjoyed a merry, wholesome life. The house was\n\nalways full of visitors--some of them more or less permanent--including\n\ntraveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns\n\nseeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among\n\ntheir kinsfolk. Because it was large and suitable, the cloister\n\nsometimes was used as a hospital, and it was not unusual for the\n\n\"family\" to number as many as twenty-five. Guests who stayed for any\n\nlength of time were expected to take part in household duties,\n\nparticipate in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions.\n\nMusic, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling were forms of recreation.\n\nThrough Kathie's economy, improvements were made in the Luther house. An\n\norchard, hop garden, and finally a farm were purchased.\n\n\n\nWhen Luther worried about his children's future he overcame it with\n\nfaith. A pious training is most important, he wrote. It is good to leave\n\nan inheritance, but preparing children to manage wisely is more\n\nimportant. We parents are fools if we don't train them to fear God, to\n\ncontrol themselves, and to live honorably.\n\n\n\n= A CHURCH REBORN\n\n\n\n== The National Conscience\n\n\n\nThe people at Wittenberg and in other cities of influence were gradually\n\nlearning to think of the church as separate from the Roman hierarchy.\n\nNow there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was\n\nessential and arrangements had to be made for their training and\n\nsupport. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of\n\nendeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had\n\nlapsed into indifference.\n\n\n\nLuther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new\n\nchurch might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted\n\nhim. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use\n\nhe felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper\n\ninstruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there\n\nhad to be some sort of oversight.\n\n\n\nThe bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were\n\nloath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon\n\nthe congregations and in some cases the city councils to select\n\ncompetent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up\n\nschools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees\n\ncomprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony\n\nbeginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of\n\nGermany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization\n\nbegan.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime two distinct factions had developed among the princes of\n\nGermany. One espoused the Roman cause, the other the Reformation. From\n\n1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival\n\nprinces concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition\n\nto, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts\n\nwhich had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic\n\nprinces, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution\n\npreventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the\n\nReformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an\n\nindividual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to\n\noppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared\n\nonly eight years before were becoming the national mind.\n\n\n\n== The Augsburg Confession\n\n\n\nSparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing\n\ninto Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major\n\npurpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to\n\nharmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with\n\nRome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or\n\nconfession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were\n\nactually submitted.\n\n\n\nAs usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced\n\nthe emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best\n\nammunition for the Saxon \"heretics,\" fully confident that a Lutheran\n\ndefeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.\n\n\n\nStill under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at\n\na castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others\n\nappearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight\n\narticles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The\n\nfirst twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures\n\nregarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church,\n\nthe Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin,\n\nGood Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of\n\nRoman abuses which contradict the Word of God.\n\n\n\nThe emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation.\n\nOn the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church\n\nproperty restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the\n\nprinting or sale of Lutheran writings.\n\n\n\nDejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home\n\nin the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic\n\ncreed of the largest Protestant body in the world.\n\n\n\nThreatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with\n\nother Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was\n\naverted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish\n\ninvasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was\n\ndelayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months\n\nearlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead\n\nof fear.\n\n\n\n== Back to Eisleben\n\n\n\nThe circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace,\n\nwhere he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died\n\nearly on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing\n\nhimself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.\n\n\n\nLuther's lifetime was marked with concern--concern first about himself\n\nand God. It wasn't selfish; a man has to find his treasure before he can\n\nshare it. Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a\n\nmonastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he\n\nfound the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's\n\nrevelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is\n\nlove instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man\n\nand that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for\n\nhimself. It is God's free gift.\n\n\n\nThen his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to\n\nkeep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of\n\nevil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to\n\nstop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so\n\nsoft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the\n\nramparts of his mighty-fortress God.\n\n\n\n\"The devil prefers blockheads,\" he said, therefore, \"the school must be\n\nthe next thing to the church.\" Concern led him to teach. Professor was\n\nthe only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who\n\narrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the\n\ntruth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred\n\nScriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were\n\ntranslated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic\n\nsimplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would\n\nunderstand it that way too.\n\n\n\nThe principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the\n\npromise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount\n\nthe humility of his service: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church\n\nin conformity with the Scriptures.

            "text": "The Turk was slashing his way up the valley of the Danube into the heart of Europe. God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest lurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.\nInto such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by superstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm, convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a Christian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth was lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the impact of his life.\nThe Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning after his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They had moved recently from the farming community of MÃ¶hra, home of the Luther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the copper mines.\nWhen Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by Mansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time Martin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was the custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door with one of the school choirs.\nHe stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish school of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by singing and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a woman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar into her home.\nHans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was seventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of Erfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had passed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.\nObedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began his post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field of law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the whole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian monastery.\nHans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were astounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in the words \"religious experience.\"\nHis parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early influence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and the last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle ages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school. His introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and shortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness and heaven.\n\nSeveral grim incidents increased his anxiety. While on a holiday from the university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his student sword. He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague moved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to Mansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning struck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\" Fifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of the \"Black Cloister,\" monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in Erfurt.\nThat this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and that his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of a monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university, later proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.\nLuther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain for several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being examined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was shaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl, and formally received as a novice.\nHe scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various ascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended Luther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was received into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and scholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for the priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.\nThe petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's energy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic theology available at that time. However, long hours with books did little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.\n\nAlthough his heart was not at rest, Luther continued to perform his priestly duties and undertake any new tasks assigned to him. In the fall of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been entrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established University of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of the Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called back to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for about a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another monk on a mission to Rome.\nIn the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible. His high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of its reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church remained unshaken.",

                            "text": "In the chapter \"THE MINER'S SON\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" we are introduced to the tumultuous and fear-ridden world into which Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. The era was marked by the advance of the Turks into Europe, a distant and vengeful perception of God, and widespread superstition, including fears of witches and demons. Despite these challenges, Luther emerged as a figure of resilience, deeply convinced of God's love and mercy, and possessed of a common sense that would later make him a pivotal figure in Christian history.\n\nThe narrative begins with Luther's humble origins, born to Hans and Margarethe Luther, industrious but simple folk who had recently moved in hopes of prosperity through the copper mines. Luther's early life was characterized by hardship, but also by his parents' determination to provide him with an education, which saw him moving from singing and begging for his keep to being taken in by Frau Ursula Cotta, a cultured woman who recognized his potential.\n\nLuther's academic journey was marked by diligence and success, leading him to the University of Erfurt, where he achieved both his bachelor's and master's degrees. Despite his father's wishes for him to pursue a career in law, Luther experienced a profound religious calling that led him to abandon his studies and enter an Augustinian monastery in 1505. This decision, spurred by a series of life-threatening events and a deep-seated fear of sin and damnation, marked a pivotal turn in Luther's life.\n\nHis time in the monastery was characterized by rigorous ascetic practices, but also by a growing dissatisfaction with the scholastic theology of the time, which emphasized personal effort in achieving divine favor. Despite his efforts, Luther found no peace of conscience, leading him to continue his theological studies with the hope of finding answers.\n\nLuther's priestly duties and his appointment to the chair of moral philosophy at the University of Wittenberg allowed him to delve deeper into theology, eventually leading to a mission to Rome. This journey, while initially undertaken with reverence, ultimately left Luther disillusioned with the opulence and scandal he observed at the papal court, though his faith in the church itself remained intact.\n\nThrough the detailed recounting of Luther's early life, \"THE MINER'S SON\" chapter not only provides insight into the formative experiences that shaped one of Christianity's most influential figures but also paints a vivid picture of the socio-religious context of late medieval Europe. Koppenhaver's narrative captures the essence of Luther's journey from a miner's son to a devout monk and scholar, setting the stage for his eventual role in the Reformation.",

Firstly, there was a military threat as \"The Turk was slashing his way up the valley of the Danube into the heart of Europe,\" indicating the Ottoman Empire's aggressive expansion into European territories. This created a climate of fear and insecurity among the European populace.\n\nSecondly, the perception of God and the spiritual atmosphere of the time was quite grim. The text describes that \"God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind.\" This suggests that the prevailing religious sentiment was one of fear and dread, with God being viewed more as a punitive figure than a source of love and mercy.\n\nAdditionally, the societal conditions were rife with superstition and fear of the supernatural. The presence of \"witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction\" in the forests indicates a widespread belief in and fear of the supernatural, which contributed to an atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia.\n\nThese conditions of military threat, a punitive religious outlook, and superstition created a world that was \"threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by superstition,\" into which Martin Luther was born. This environment would have a profound impact on Luther and his future endeavors, shaping his views and actions in significant ways.",

Born into a world filled with fear, superstition, and religious fervor, Luther was introduced to a life of piety and hard work from an early age. His parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were described as \"simple, industrious folk,\" which likely instilled in him the values of diligence and perseverance. The family's move from MÃ¶hra to Eisleben, and then to Mansfeld, was driven by Hans Luther's ambition to improve their financial situation, particularly through his work in the copper mines. This ambition also influenced the family's ability to provide for Martin's education.\n\nDespite the initial financial hardships, Hans Luther's efforts eventually allowed him to send Martin to school. The text notes, \"it was with difficulty that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school,\" highlighting the sacrifices the family made for Martin's education. By the time Martin was thirteen, the family's improved financial situation enabled Hans to send him to a school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg, where Martin earned his board by singing and begging with one of the school choirs. This experience not only reflects the family's commitment to Martin's education but also Martin's own resilience and willingness to work for his advancement.\n\nMartin's education continued in Eisenach at the parish school of St. George, where he again supported himself by singing and begging. It was here that he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, who took him into her home, providing him with a more stable and nurturing environment that likely contributed to his academic and personal development.\n\nBy the time Martin was seventeen, the family's financial situation had improved sufficiently to allow his entrance to the University of Erfurt. Here, Martin worked diligently and excelled academically, completing both his bachelor's and master's examinations. His father's wishes for him to enter the field of law demonstrate Hans Luther's aspirations for his son's future, indicating a desire for Martin to achieve a level of success and stability that perhaps the family had not previously known.\n\nIn summary, Martin Luther's upbringing and family background played a crucial role in shaping his early life and education. The values of hard work and perseverance instilled by his parents, combined with their sacrifices and support, laid the foundation for his academic achievements and his eventual path toward religious reform.",

This upbringing in a religious environment set the stage for his later spiritual decisions.\n\n2. **Fear of Hell and the Last Judgment**: Like many people at the close of the Middle Ages, Luther shared a common fear of hell, purgatory, and the last judgment. This fear was a significant factor in his contemplation of his spiritual path.\n\n3. **Discovery of the Bible**: During his time at the university, Luther discovered a complete Bible in the library. He was \"tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents,\" which sparked a deeper interest in religious study and reflection on his own spiritual state.\n\n4. **Regular Church Attendance and Devotion**: Luther attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly throughout his school years, further embedding religious practice and contemplation in his daily life.\n\n5. **Introspective Nature**: His introspective nature made him acutely aware of his sins and shortcomings. This self-awareness and desire for forgiveness played a crucial role in his decision to pursue a monastic life, which was considered the best way to forgiveness and heaven.\n\n6. **Grim Incidents and Vow**: Several grim incidents increased his anxiety about his spiritual state and the afterlife. Notably, a near-death experience due to an accident, the death of fellow students during a plague, and a life-threatening thunderstorm during which he was nearly struck by lightning. Overcome by panic during the thunderstorm, he invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed, \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\" This vow, made in a moment of extreme fear and desperation, was a direct catalyst for his decision to join the monastery.\n\nThe text summarizes these influences and experiences, concluding that his decision to become a monk can be summed up in the words \"religious experience.\" This indicates that it was not a single event but a culmination of his upbringing, personal fears, religious discoveries, and life-threatening experiences that led Martin Luther to abandon his law studies and seek admission to the Augustinian monastery in 1505.",

These incidents intensified his anxiety about life, death, and his spiritual state, pushing him towards a religious life as a means of seeking forgiveness and heaven.\n\n1. **Accidental Injury**: The text mentions that \"While on a holiday from the university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his student sword.\" This incident nearly led to his death from bleeding, and in his distress, he prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. This experience of coming close to death and seeking divine intervention in a moment of panic likely heightened his awareness of his mortality and vulnerability, making him more receptive to a religious calling.\n\n2. **Plague**: The death of a number of students during a plague deeply moved Luther. Witnessing the deaths of his peers would have confronted him with the fragility of life and the reality of death, further amplifying his concerns about his spiritual well-being and the afterlife.\n\n3. **Thunderstorm Incident**: The most pivotal incident occurred when Luther was returning to Erfurt after a visit to Mansfeld. He was caught in a heavy thunderstorm, and \"a bolt of lightning struck so close that he was knocked to the ground.\" Overcome by panic, he invoked St. Anna for aid and made a vow: \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\" This moment of fearing for his life and making a vow in the hope of divine protection directly led to his decision to enter the monastery.\n\nThese incidents, combined with his existing religious inclinations and fears about hell, purgatory, and the last judgment, culminated in his decision to pursue a monastic life. The text summarizes this by stating, \"Many factors contributed, but in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in the words 'religious experience.'\" This suggests that these life-threatening incidents, by increasing his religious fervor and fear of death, played a crucial role in his decision to become a monk.",

His subsequent focus on the scriptures as the primary source of religious authority became a cornerstone of Protestantism.\n\n3. **Intellectual and Spiritual Unrest**: \"However, long hours with books did little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.\" Luther's intellectual and spiritual unrest during his time at Erfurt, fueled by his studies and the scholastic theology available at that time, laid the groundwork for his later theological breakthroughs, such as the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\n4. **Preparation for Teaching and Theological Studies**: \"In the fall of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy... Desiring to teach theology rather than logic and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of the Bible.\" Luther's academic preparation and teaching experience at the University of Erfurt equipped him with the skills and knowledge necessary to become a leading figure in theological education and debate, which were crucial for the spread of Protestant ideas.\n\nIn summary, Martin Luther's time at the University of Erfurt was instrumental in shaping his theological insights, his approach to scripture, and his academic and teaching career, all of which played significant roles in his contributions to the Protestant Church.",

This period was likely intended to ensure that he was fully committed to the monastic life and that he met the monastery's standards for acceptance.\n\nIn September 1505, after this period of examination was deemed satisfactory by all parties involved, Luther underwent a significant transition into monastic life. His head was shaved, and he was \"invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl,\" marking his formal reception as a novice into the Order of Augustinian Hermits. This ceremony symbolized his official entry into the monastic community and his commitment to the monastic vows.\n\nFollowing his formal acceptance, Luther engaged in the daily life and duties of a monk. He was involved in \"scrubbing the floors, begging in the streets, and engaged in various ascetic and spiritual exercises.\" These activities were part of his probationary year, during which he lived according to the vows of \"obedience, poverty, and chastity.\" This period was designed to deepen his spiritual life, humble him through manual labor, and test his commitment to the monastic vows.\n\nAt the end of this probationary year, Luther's sincere piety and scholarship had evidently impressed his superiors, as he was encouraged to prepare for the priesthood. This led to his ordination on April 4, 1507, marking the beginning of his priestly duties and further studies within the monastery.\n\nThroughout these initial months, Luther's experiences at the monastery were characterized by a rigorous examination of his commitment, the adoption of the monastic lifestyle through symbolic and practical means, and the commencement of his religious and scholarly pursuits within the monastic community.",

Despite his father's wishes for him to enter the field of law, Luther experienced a profound \"religious experience\" that led him to reject his post-graduate studies in law and instead apply for admission to an Augustinian monastery.

He was baptized the morning after his birth and named for the saint of the day, indicating the religious significance placed on his life from the start. His parents were described as \"God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early influence on him.\" This early exposure to devout Christianity played a crucial role in shaping his religious convictions.\n\n2. **Academic Excellence and Rigor**: Luther's education was comprehensive and challenging. He attended schools conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life and the parish school of St. George, where he earned his keep by singing and begging. His diligence in studies allowed him to pass \"not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations\" at the University of Erfurt. This academic background not only provided Luther with a strong intellectual foundation but also exposed him to a wide range of theological and philosophical ideas.\n\n3. **Critical Encounters and Decisions**: Several life-changing incidents increased his religious anxiety and led him to a deeper spiritual introspection. Notably, an accident where he \"accidentally severed an artery in his leg,\" the death of fellow students during a plague, and a near-death experience during a thunderstorm where he vowed to become a monk if spared. These incidents intensified his religious fervor and led him to the monastic life, a decision that was \"summed up in the words 'religious experience.'\"\n\n4. **Monastic Life and Theological Inquiry**: Luther's time in the monastery was marked by rigorous spiritual and ascetic practices, but it was also a period of profound theological inquiry and dissatisfaction. He engaged in \"various ascetic and spiritual exercises\" and devoted himself to studying scholastic theology, which ultimately did little to \"ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought.\" His sincere piety and scholarship impressed his superiors, leading him to be ordained as a priest and later to teach at the University of Wittenberg. However, his critical engagement with theological texts led him to question the efficacy of penitence and fastings to compensate for sins, indicating the beginnings of his theological divergence from established church doctrine.\n\n5. **Exposure to Church Practices**: His mission to Rome exposed him to the practices of the church, where he observed \"its reckless luxury and scandal.\" Although his confidence in the church remained unshaken at that time, this experience likely contributed to his later critique of church practices and indulgences.\n\nIn summary, Martin Luther's early life was characterized by a deep religious piety, rigorous academic training, critical personal experiences, and a profound engagement with theological questions. These elements combined to prepare him for his future role in the Protestant Reformation, providing him with the intellectual, spiritual, and moral foundation to challenge and reform church practices and teachings.",

His intense engagement with scholastic theology, as mentioned in the text, did \"little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought within the cloister walls.\" This suggests that his academic and religious pursuits deepened his awareness of the dissonance between the church's teachings and his personal quest for spiritual peace.\n\nThe text further elaborates that the theological books he studied taught him \"to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God,\" a notion that Luther found difficult to accept. He was \"too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.\" This critical reflection on his own spiritual practices and the church's teachings evidently led him to question the efficacy of actions (like penitence and fasting) traditionally prescribed for achieving salvation and favor with God.\n\nThrough his ordination and subsequent duties, while Luther continued to perform his priestly responsibilities, the text indicates that his heart was not at peace with the conventional understanding of faith and salvation. His experiences, both in studying theology and in practicing as a priest, thus played a crucial role in shaping his evolving understanding of faith and salvation, steering him towards a path that would eventually lead to significant doctrinal shifts in Christianity.",

                    "text": "The Turk was slashing his way up the valley of the Danube into the heart of Europe. God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest lurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.\nInto such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by superstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm, convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a Christian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth was lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the impact of his life.\nThe Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning after his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They had moved recently from the farming community of MÃ¶hra, home of the Luther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the copper mines.\nWhen Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by Mansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time Martin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was the custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door with one of the school choirs.\nHe stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish school of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by singing and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a woman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar into her home.\nHans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was seventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of Erfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had passed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.\nObedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began his post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field of law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the whole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian monastery.\nHans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were astounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in the words \"religious experience.\"\nHis parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early influence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and the last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle ages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school. His introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and shortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness and heaven.",

His parents, who were described as \"God-fearing people,\" instilled piety in him from an early age. Luther shared the common fear of \"the horrors of hell, purgatory, and the last judgment\" prevalent during the middle ages. Additionally, his introspective nature made him acutely aware of his sins and shortcomings. These factors led him to seek forgiveness and heaven through the life of a monk, as it was believed to be the best path for salvation. Luther's upbringing in a world filled with fear, superstition, and religious devotion influenced his character to become \"disdainful of bodily harm, convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense.\"",

Thirdly, Luther's encounter with a complete Bible in the university library highlighted his ignorance of its contents, leading him to seek a deeper understanding of his faith. Finally, Luther's introspective nature made him acutely aware of his sins and the need for forgiveness, which he believed could be best achieved through the monastic life.

His upbringing in a world \"ruled by fear, and plagued by superstition\" influenced his early religious beliefs, instilling in him a fear of divine judgment and a desire for forgiveness through a life of piety. Luther's exposure to the Bible and his introspective nature during his education led him to question the traditional teachings of the church and seek a deeper understanding of God's mercy and grace. This ultimately led him to reject his initial path of studying law and instead join an Augustinian monastery, where he pursued a life dedicated to seeking forgiveness and salvation.\n\nFurthermore, Luther's experiences with religious practices and his studies at the University of Erfurt shaped his theological views. His encounter with a complete Bible in the university library and his realization of his ignorance of its contents prompted him to delve into scripture and develop a more profound understanding of Christian doctrine. This, combined with his introspective nature and awareness of his own sins, fueled his theological journey towards emphasizing faith and grace as the means to salvation, rather than relying solely on external rituals and works.\n\nIn summary, Martin Luther's education and experiences, from his upbringing in a superstitious and fearful world to his academic pursuits and decision to become a monk, all played a crucial role in shaping his later theological views that challenged the established norms of the Catholic Church and sparked the Protestant Reformation.",

                                            "text": "Martin Luther's experiences as a monk significantly shaped his theological perspectives and future actions. As mentioned in the text, Luther's decision to become a monk was influenced by various factors, including his upbringing in a God-fearing household, his fear of divine judgment, and his introspective nature. Living as a monk allowed Luther to delve deeper into his religious beliefs and seek forgiveness for his sins. This experience led him to question the practices of the Catholic Church and eventually sparked the Protestant Reformation.\n\nThe text states, \"Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness and heaven.\" This belief in the efficacy of monastic life for salvation likely influenced Luther's theological perspective on the role of works in achieving salvation. Additionally, Luther's time as a monk provided him with the opportunity to study the Bible extensively, leading to a profound impact on his understanding of scripture and theology.\n\nFurthermore, Luther's experiences as a monk instilled in him a sense of moral responsibility and a desire for reform within the Church. This can be seen in his later actions, such as the posting of the 95 Theses, where he criticized the sale of indulgences and called for a return to the teachings of the Bible.\n\nIn conclusion, Martin Luther's experiences as a monk not only shaped his theological perspectives by influencing his views on salvation and scripture but also paved the way for his future actions as a reformer within the Catholic Church.",

He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague moved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to Mansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning struck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\" Fifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of the \"Black Cloister,\" monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in Erfurt.\nThat this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and that his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of a monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university, later proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.\nLuther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain for several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being examined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was shaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl, and formally received as a novice.\nHe scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various ascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended Luther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was received into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and scholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for the priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.\nThe petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's energy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic theology available at that time. However, long hours with books did little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.",

While at the university, Luther was in an \"unrestricted atmosphere of a great university,\" where he was exposed to a wide range of knowledge and ideas. He studied diligently and successfully completed his bachelor's and master's examinations. In contrast, his experiences in the monastery involved more ascetic practices and spiritual exercises. Luther scrubbed floors, begged in the streets, and took vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. Despite his scholarly pursuits in the monastery, Luther struggled to find peace of conscience within its walls, as the text mentions, \"The books taught him to rely on his own efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to compensate for his sins.\"",

In the fall of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been entrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established University of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of the Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called back to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for about a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another monk on a mission to Rome.\nIn the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible. His high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of its reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church remained unshaken.",

            "text": "Luther returned to Erfurt from Rome, and in the summer of 1511 was sent as one of three new professors to Wittenberg. Here he came under the influence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who showed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.\nAs yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but he never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried the path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than could be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.\nLuther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined stages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series of crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave periods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through his own works.\nStaupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's weakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was no striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual found peace in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts were virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with self-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.\n\nLuther's troubled spirit did not lower him in the vicar's estimation and, perhaps to get his mind off it, Staupitz advised him to study for a doctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university. It was good medicine, for thus the distressed monk came to closer grips with the source book of his faith. So far, writings about the Bible, rather than the book itself, had been his main diet. He studied for the degree and preached in the monastery's rickety chapel until October 18-19, 1512, when he became Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture, professor of Bible at Wittenberg University.\nSince May, 1512, Luther had been subprior and regent in the school connected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg. In May, 1515, he became district vicar for Thuringia and Meissen, having eleven monasteries under his care. Meanwhile he was discharging his duties as professor in the university.\nFrequently the solution to great problems comes quite undramatically as one goes about the daily tasks. Luther's awakening to a God who makes man righteous in order to save him came in such a way. He knew the teaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked himself, is righteous?\nAs he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries, he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that grace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New Testament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this came the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\nAt this point Luther still felt that he was in total agreement with the teachings of the Roman Church. In a humble way he believed that he had discovered for himself what always had been--that he had just been slow in catching on. Deeper study, however, made it clear to him that there was a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle ages. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. This indeed was not the work of an implacable judge, but of a loving Father.\nLuther now found himself rejecting most of the medieval writers and teachers. He went back to the Bible, to Christ, and the apostles. Convinced of the truth, he no longer was restrained by contradictory views. His beliefs were contrary to many of the teachings of the church, and while he didn't plan it that way they brought him into open revolt. The matter of indulgences opened the battle.",

                            "text": "In the chapter titled \"THE PROFESSOR\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" the narrative delves into a significant period of Luther's life, marking his transition from an earnest young priest grappling with profound theological doubts to a revolutionary figure challenging the core tenets of the medieval church. Upon his return from Rome, Luther is appointed as a professor at Wittenberg in the summer of 1511, where he falls under the mentorship of John von Staupitz, the vicar of the Augustinian order. Staupitz plays a crucial role in Luther's spiritual journey, offering him warmth, understanding, and guidance through his crises of faith.\n\nLuther's early theological struggles are characterized by an intense pursuit of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness, which he initially seeks through good works and confession. However, he finds these methods inadequate for attaining salvation, leading to a series of spiritual crises. Staupitz's theology, emphasizing complete surrender to God's grace rather than self-assertion through works, contrasts sharply with Luther's efforts. Despite attempting to embrace Staupitz's mystical approach, Luther cannot reconcile it with his own view of God as a judgmental figure.\n\nTo alleviate Luther's distress, Staupitz advises him to pursue a doctorate in sacred scripture and assume the chair of Bible at Wittenberg University. This shift towards academic and pastoral responsibilities, including becoming subprior and district vicar overseeing multiple monasteries, inadvertently sets the stage for Luther's theological breakthrough. Through his engagement with the Bible and his duties, Luther comes to reject the medieval notion that grace is earned, embracing instead the doctrine of \"justification by faith\" â the belief that salvation is a free gift from God, not a reward for human righteousness.\n\nLuther's newfound understanding marks a departure from the teachings of the Roman Church, though he initially believes he is merely rediscovering established truths. Deeper study convinces him of the stark contrast between his beliefs and medieval theology, particularly the idea that salvation is solely the work of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This realization leads Luther to reject the authority of medieval writers and church teachings that contradict the Bible, setting him on a path of open revolt against the church, beginning with his opposition to the sale of indulgencies.\n\nThe chapter encapsulates Luther's transformation from a troubled monk into a pioneering theologian, whose personal quest for understanding God's grace lays the foundation for challenging the church's prevailing doctrines and practices, ultimately leading to the Protestant Reformation. Through Koppenhaver's narrative, we witness the intricate interplay of mentorship, personal struggle, and scholarly pursuit that culminates in Luther's radical theological insights, reshaping the Christian faith and the church's role in salvation.",

Staupitz encouraged Luther \"to trust in the God who loved and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through his own works.\" Staupitz's theology, which was quite different from Luther's initial beliefs, emphasized man's weakness and the need to completely submerge oneself in God, finding peace in being surrounded entirely by God's presence, without striving or self-assertion.\n\nSecondly, Luther's own studies and responsibilities contributed to this shift. As he studied for his doctor's degree, preached, and assumed the role of professor of Bible at Wittenberg University, he engaged more deeply with the Bible itself, moving away from writings about the Bible that had previously been his main source of theological understanding. This closer engagement with the Bible led him to the realization that \"grace can't be earned. God gives it.\" He discovered that the medieval concept of earning grace was misleading and contrary to the New Testament, understanding that \"It is God who makes man righteous\" as a free gift (grace) so that man can be saved, which is the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\nFinally, Luther's deeper study and reflection led him to recognize a significant difference between his own understanding and the theology of the middle ages. He became convinced that \"man can contribute nothing toward his salvation\" and that salvation comes from God recognizing man's unrighteousness and redeeming him through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. This realization marked a departure from viewing God as an implacable judge to understanding Him as a loving Father.\n\nIn summary, Luther's shift in perspective was influenced by the guidance of John von Staupitz, his deeper engagement with the Bible and theological studies, and his realization of the fundamental differences between his understanding of grace, righteousness, and salvation and that of medieval theology.",

This support was crucial for Luther, who was earnestly seeking to understand and experience God's grace.\n\n2. **Encouraging Trust in God's Love**: Staupitz encouraged Luther to trust in the God who loved humanity and sent his Son to redeem mankind, rather than trying to appease God through his own works. This advice was aimed at shifting Luther's focus from self-reliant efforts to earn salvation towards a faith-based understanding of God's grace.\n\n3. **Introducing a Different Theological Perspective**: Staupitz's theology, which was quite different from Luther's initial views, emphasized man's weakness and the need to completely submerge oneself in God, without striving or self-assertion. This perspective introduced Luther to a more passive and trust-based approach to faith, although Luther found it challenging to fully embrace this view due to his conception of God as an angry judge.\n\n4. **Advising Academic Pursuit**: Perhaps to help Luther divert his mind from his spiritual troubles, Staupitz advised him to study for a doctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university. This academic pursuit led Luther to engage more deeply with the Bible itself, rather than secondary writings about it, which played a crucial role in his theological development.\n\nThrough these contributions, Staupitz significantly influenced Luther's early spiritual development, providing both direct guidance and opportunities for Luther to explore and understand his faith more deeply.",

He advocated for a complete submersion in God, without striving or self-assertion. In contrast, Luther's efforts were characterized by self-assertion aimed at winning merit. He was focused on personal acts and merits as means to salvation. This is highlighted when the text states, \"Staupitz did much to comfort him... rather than try to appease God through his own works,\" and contrasts it with Luther's approach, \"His every act was replete with self-assertion directed toward winning merit.\"\n\n2. **Concept of Self and God**: Staupitz's theology admitted human weakness and called for individuals to lose themselves in God, finding peace in a blissful atmosphere entirely surrounded by God. Luther, however, struggled with this mystical way and could not fully embrace it because he viewed God as an angry judge, which made it difficult for him to completely lose himself in God's essence. This is evident from the statement, \"He tried the mystical way of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.\"\n\n3. **Understanding of Grace and Righteousness**: Luther eventually came to the realization that grace cannot be earned through works, but is a free gift from God, leading to the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\" This understanding marked a departure from the medieval concept that grace could be earned, which had been his previous belief influenced by the prevailing theology of the time, including aspects of Staupitz's teachings. The text explains this evolution of thought, \"Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous.\"\n\n4. **Rejection of Medieval Theology**: Luther's deeper study led him to reject most of the medieval writers and teachers, including, by implication, aspects of Staupitz's theology that aligned with those medieval concepts. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, which was a stark contrast to the medieval theology that emphasized works. The text underscores this shift, \"He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nIn summary, Luther's approach to faith and salvation differed from Staupitz's theology primarily in his emphasis on self-assertion and works, his struggle with the concept of a loving God versus an angry judge, his realization that grace is a free gift leading to justification by faith, and his eventual rejection of medieval theological concepts that included works as a means to salvation.",

This role placed him in an academic environment that facilitated his engagement with theological issues.\n\n2. **Doctor of Sacred Scripture, Professor of Bible at Wittenberg University**: Advised by Staupitz, Luther studied for a doctor's degree and assumed the chair of Bible at the university. The text mentions, \"It was good medicine, for thus the distressed monk came to closer grips with the source book of his faith.\" This role significantly deepened his engagement with the Bible, shifting his focus from writings about the Bible to the Bible itself, which was pivotal in the development of his theological insights.\n\n3. **Subprior and Regent in the School Connected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg**: Since May 1512, Luther held these responsibilities, which likely involved administrative and educational duties within the monastic community and its associated school. This role would have kept him closely connected to the religious and educational life of the monastery.\n\n4. **District Vicar for Thuringia and Meissen**: In May 1515, Luther became district vicar, having eleven monasteries under his care. This role expanded his responsibilities and influence within the religious community, overseeing multiple monasteries.\n\nThese roles influenced his theological insights in several ways. Firstly, his academic positions allowed him to study the Bible intensively, leading him to question and eventually reject the medieval concept that grace could be earned. The text explains, \"As he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries, he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that grace could be earned.\" This realization was foundational to his doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\nSecondly, his responsibilities within the monastery and as district vicar provided him with practical experiences that informed his theological reflections. His daily tasks and pastoral care likely exposed him to the real-life implications of theological doctrines, further shaping his understanding of faith, grace, and salvation.\n\nIn summary, Luther's roles within the monastery and university were instrumental in shaping his theological insights, particularly his critical engagement with the Bible and his development of the doctrine of justification by faith. These roles provided him with the academic and practical context necessary for his theological evolution.",

Initially, Luther was influenced by the medieval concept that grace could be earned through good works and self-assertion. However, as he engaged more deeply with the Bible, particularly in his role as a professor of Bible at Wittenberg University, he began to question this belief.\n\nLuther's awakening came as he pondered the question, \"But who, he asked himself, is righteous?\" Through his studies and teachings, he gradually discovered that the medieval concept of earning grace was contrary to the New Testament. He realized that \"Grace can't be earned. God gives it.\" This led him to understand that righteousness is not something that man can achieve on his own through works or merits. Instead, \"It is God who makes man righteous,\" and He does so as a \"free gift (grace) so that he can be saved.\"\n\nThis understanding marked a significant shift from the prevailing beliefs of the time. Luther concluded that man cannot contribute anything toward his salvation; rather, it is entirely the work of God, who, recognizing man's unrighteousness, redeems and restores him through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ.

Luther found that, according to the New Testament, \"Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous.

His deeper study made it clear to him that \"there was a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle ages,\" particularly in the belief that man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, but that salvation comes through God's recognition of man's unrighteousness and His decision to redeem and restore man through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ.",

As he studied and taught, Luther realized that he had been misled by the medieval concept that grace could be earned. This realization was contrary to what he found in the New Testament, where it is stated that \"Grace can't be earned. God gives it.\" This epiphany led him to understand that \"Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous.\" This understanding culminated in the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\nThis shift in understanding significantly shaped Luther's theological stance. He became convinced that \"man can contribute nothing toward his salvation,\" a stark departure from the medieval theology that emphasized the earning of grace through good works. Luther recognized that salvation was a result of God's grace, freely given, acknowledging man's unrighteousness and redeeming him through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. This perspective saw God not as \"an implacable judge, but of a loving Father.\"\n\nLuther's rejection of medieval teachings and his embrace of justification by faith led him to distance himself from most medieval writers and teachers, returning instead to the foundational Christian texts: the Bible, Christ, and the apostles. This theological stance was not only a personal conviction but also became a public matter, as it contradicted many of the teachings of the church at the time. This contradiction, particularly around the issue of indulgences, eventually \"brought him into open revolt,\" marking a significant turning point in Luther's life and in the broader religious landscape of the period.",

He discovered that \"Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous.\" This realization led to the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"\n\nAs Luther delved deeper into his studies, he found that his beliefs were significantly different from the theology of the middle ages, particularly the notion that \"man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.\" This understanding was not in line with the work of an \"implacable judge, but of a loving Father.\"\n\nLuther's growing convictions led him to reject most of the medieval writers and teachers, turning back to the Bible, Christ, and the apostles. As he became more convinced of his beliefs and less restrained by contradictory views, his teachings started to diverge from many of the church's teachings. This divergence, although not initially intended to provoke conflict, \"brought him into open revolt\" against the church. The specific matter that opened the battle was the issue of indulgences, which directly contradicted Luther's newfound understanding of salvation and grace as unearnable and freely given by God, not something to be bought or sold as the church's practice of indulgences implied.",

Here he came under the influence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who showed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.\nAs yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but he never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried the path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than could be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.\nLuther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined stages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series of crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave periods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through his own works.\nStaupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's weakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was no striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual found peace in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts were virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with self-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.",

Staupitz showed \"warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest\" and encouraged Luther to trust in God's love and redemption rather than relying solely on his own works. Staupitz's theology, which focused on man's weakness and complete submersion in God, differed from Luther's approach of self-assertion and striving for merit. Despite Staupitz's efforts to guide Luther towards a more peaceful and trusting relationship with God, Luther struggled to fully embrace this perspective and continued to feel the weight of his own efforts and perceived inadequacies in appeasing God.",

Eventually the individual found peace in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God.\"\n\nThis comparison highlights the contrast between Luther's belief in the need to earn salvation through personal efforts and Staupitz's emphasis on surrendering to God's love and redemption.

He studied for the degree and preached in the monastery's rickety chapel until October 18-19, 1512, when he became Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture, professor of Bible at Wittenberg University.\nSince May, 1512, Luther had been subprior and regent in the school connected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg. In May, 1515, he became district vicar for Thuringia and Meissen, having eleven monasteries under his care. Meanwhile he was discharging his duties as professor in the university.\nFrequently the solution to great problems comes quite undramatically as one goes about the daily tasks. Luther's awakening to a God who makes man righteous in order to save him came in such a way. He knew the teaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked himself, is righteous?\nAs he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries, he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that grace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New Testament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this came the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"",

This realization led Luther to the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\" As the text states, \"He knew the teaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked himself, is righteous?... Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved.\" Luther's role as a professor of Bible allowed him to delve deeper into the scriptures and ultimately led him to a transformative understanding of faith and grace.",

Firstly, he came to closer grips with the source book of his faith, the Bible, by studying it directly rather than relying on writings about it. This helped him in his spiritual journey as he delved deeper into the scriptures. Secondly, he obtained a doctor's degree in sacred scripture, marking a notable academic achievement. Lastly, he began to question and eventually reject the medieval concept that grace could be earned, realizing that it is God who makes man righteous as a free gift. This realization led to the development of his doctrine of \"justification by faith.\" These changes marked a pivotal moment in Luther's life where he started to challenge traditional beliefs and develop his own theological understanding based on his studies and experiences as a professor of Bible at Wittenberg University.",

Deeper study, however, made it clear to him that there was a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle ages. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. This indeed was not the work of an implacable judge, but of a loving Father.\nLuther now found himself rejecting most of the medieval writers and teachers. He went back to the Bible, to Christ, and the apostles. Convinced of the truth, he no longer was restrained by contradictory views. His beliefs were contrary to many of the teachings of the church, and while he didn't plan it that way they brought him into open revolt. The matter of indulgences opened the battle.",

            "text": "The Roman Church taught that forgiveness of sins could be secured only through the sacrament of penance. This required contrition of heart, confession to a priest, and satisfaction by good works. Release from the penalty of eternal punishment was guaranteed by the absolution pronounced by the priest. If not enough works of penance were done before death, however, the remainder had to be atoned for in the torments of purgatory for an indefinite period.\nGradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences to offset purgatorial punishment. It was at this point that Luther's theology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift, but indulgences implied that man can earn grace.\nIn 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric of Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg. Because of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable investment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to be a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before negotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.\nAlbert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg. Then the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that he could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise additional sums for St. Peter's.\n\nJohn Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel. Luther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him indulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard on the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to Rome.\nThe theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration of revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to theologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence situation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.\nThe points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but merely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther maintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong experience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome sinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties which the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the departed and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.\nLuther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by attempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he thought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the theses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were applauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.\nThere had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own national affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for those who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but also for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power. Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector Frederick stood by his daring young monk.\nAs the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the cause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to enable him to publish some theses of his own.\nWhen the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students at Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire. Luther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased by their sophomoric act.\nLuther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded them to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a row between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther with heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther received notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.\nBy no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector Frederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at least have the benefit of impartial judges.\nOn second thought the pope decided not to wait sixty days and ordered the elector to arrest Luther at once and turn him over to Cardinal Cajetan for delivery in Rome. Although Frederick was not sympathetic to heresy he was determined that the man who had brought so much attention to his university at Wittenberg should have fair play. He prevailed upon the pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in Augsburg where he would be attending a diet or parliament.\nIn a benign manner the cardinal offered to help Luther out of all his difficulty if he would simply submit to the pope's authority and retract his errors. Luther of course refused and tried to defend his positions. A fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of three days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return until he was ready to recant.\nThe cardinal was quite upset by the Augsburg incident and wrote Elector Frederick a letter calling upon him to turn the heretical monk over to the Roman authorities. Frederick's reply indicated his increasing resistance to papal dictatorship. He asked for a free trial and a statement of Luther's errors in writing.\nThe pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, was dispatched to Germany in an attempt to rectify Cajetan's blundering. He correctly estimated that much of the populace was on Luther's side and the time for forcibly suppressing him was past. Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further attack in the meantime. Luther agreed, but only on the condition that his opponents would remain silent too.",

                            "text": "The chapter \"Collision with Rome\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into the profound theological and institutional conflicts between Martin Luther and the Roman Catholic Church, primarily focusing on the contentious issue of indulgences. The Roman Church's doctrine that forgiveness of sins was attainable through the sacrament of penance, involving contrition, confession, and satisfaction through good works, is outlined. This framework posited that those failing to perform sufficient penance in life would endure purgatory's torments until their sins were atoned for. The practice of purchasing indulgences emerged as a means to mitigate this purgatorial punishment, a concept Luther found fundamentally flawed, arguing that grace is a divine gift, not a commodity to be earned or bought.\n\nThe narrative unfolds with the sale of indulgences in the archbishopric of Mainz by Albert of Brandenburg, who had acquired the position through substantial financial transactions with Pope Leo X, aimed at funding the construction of St. Peter's Church in Rome. John Tetzel, a Dominican known for his effective indulgence salesmanship, led this campaign, avoiding Luther's parish due to the local indulgence traffic managed by Frederick the Wise. However, Luther's confrontation with the practice began when his parishioners purchased indulgences from Tetzel, challenging Luther's teachings on repentance with the supposed sin-remitting powers of indulgences.\n\nLuther's response was the posting of his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Castle Church on October 31, an act not of rebellion but an academic invitation to debate the indulgence issue. His theses criticized the indulgence system, emphasizing that repentance should be a continuous endeavor and that indulgences could not remit sins, a power belonging solely to God. This action, intended as a loyal attempt to reform the Church from within, unexpectedly garnered widespread public support and marked a rallying point for German resentment against the papacy's financial exploitation and political dominance.\n\nThe dispute escalated as the Dominicans, supporting Tetzel, opposed the Augustinians rallying around Luther. The situation intensified when Luther's theses reached Rome, leading to accusations of heresy and a summons for Luther to stand trial. Elector Frederick's intervention ensured that the trial would occur on German soil, reflecting the growing resistance to papal authority. Cardinal Cajetan's failed attempt to persuade Luther to recant in Augsburg, followed by the Elector's refusal to extradite Luther without a fair trial, highlighted the deepening rift.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, attempting to mediate the conflict through diplomacy, acknowledging Luther's significant popular support. Luther agreed to have his case reviewed by a German bishop, provided his opponents also ceased their attacks, setting the stage for further developments in Luther's reformative efforts.\n\nThis chapter meticulously captures the initial stages of Luther's clash with the Roman Catholic Church, underscoring the theological disputes, institutional corruption, and the broader political and social dynamics at play. It portrays Luther not as a rebel intent on division but as a reformer seeking to correct the Church's deviations from Christian doctrine.",

This practice conflicted with Luther's theology, which posited that \"Grace was God's gift,\" implying that it could not be earned or purchased through human actions such as buying indulgences. Luther saw indulgences as implying that man can earn grace, which directly contradicted his view that grace is a divine gift from God.",

Albert of Brandenburg had recently purchased the archbishopric of Mainz, which was a profitable investment due to the vast revenues the office controlled. Despite not being old enough to be a bishop and already having procured two other sees, Albert negotiated the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to overlook these irregularities \"in exchange for ten thousand ducats which he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.\"\n\nTo finance the purchase of the archbishopric, Albert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg. Subsequently, \"the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that he could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise additional sums for St. Peter's.\" This arrangement shows a direct link between the sale of indulgences in Mainz and Albert's financial dealings with Pope Leo X, as the sale of indulgences was authorized by the Pope as a means for Albert to repay the borrowed funds and simultaneously contribute financially to the construction of St. Peter's Church in Rome.",

Tetzel was a Dominican prior known for his \"shrewd aptitude in selling indulgences\" and was tasked with conducting the indulgence campaign in the archbishopric of Mainz. His campaign was part of a larger effort to raise funds for the Church of St. Peter in Rome, under the authorization of Pope Leo X and through the financial arrangements made by Albert of Brandenburg with the Fuggers banking concern.\n\nTetzel's actions indirectly provoked Luther's protest in several ways. Firstly, Tetzel did not enter Luther's parish directly because Frederick the Wise, the elector of Saxony, had his own indulgence traffic. However, \"some of Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel.\" The purchase of these indulgences by members of Luther's congregation brought the issue directly to Luther's attention. Secondly, the fundamental conflict arose when these individuals \"countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him indulgences remitting their sins.\" This direct challenge to Luther's teachings on repentance and the nature of forgiveness highlighted the theological and moral discrepancies between the church's practice of selling indulgences and Luther's understanding of grace and penance.\n\nThe culmination of Tetzel's indirect provocation of Luther was Luther's response to the situation. Feeling the need to address the abuses he perceived in the sale of indulgences and their theological implications, Luther \"tacked a placard on the door of the Castle Church\" on October 31. This act was not initially intended as a declaration of revolt but as an invitation to debate the indulgence situation, as indicated by the posting of \"the ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.\"\n\nThus, John Tetzel's role in the controversy surrounding the sale of indulgences, through his aggressive campaign and its impact on Luther's congregation, indirectly provoked Luther's protest. This set off a chain of events that led to Luther's public challenge of the church's practices, marking a significant moment in the Reformation.",

The text mentions, \"There had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own national affairs.\" This indicates that the controversy was not just about religious doctrines but also about national sovereignty and resistance to external (in this case, Roman) influence. By standing by Luther, Frederick was aligning himself with those \"who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power.\" This suggests that Frederick's support was a political maneuver to assert German autonomy against Roman influence.\n\nSecondly, on the religious front, Frederick's support of Luther was significant because it provided Luther with a platform to challenge the Church's practices without immediate repercussion. The text notes, \"Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector Frederick stood by his daring young monk.\" This indicates that Frederick was willing to overlook the religious implications of Luther's actions (i.e., attacking the indulgence system, which was a source of revenue and a key practice within the Church) in favor of supporting what he saw as a just cause. This support was crucial for Luther, as it allowed him to continue his theological challenges without being immediately silenced or punished by the Church.\n\nFurthermore, Frederick's actions in ensuring Luther received a fair trial on German soil, rather than being subjected to a potentially biased trial in Rome, underscore the political dimensions of his support. The text explains, \"By no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector Frederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at least have the benefit of impartial judges.\" Frederick's intervention here is a clear example of political support, as he used his influence to protect Luther from what they perceived as an unjust trial process under the papal authority.\n\nIn summary, the Elector Frederick's support of Luther signifies a political as well as religious dimension to the unfolding controversy by demonstrating resistance against papal interference in German affairs, providing Luther with protection and a platform to challenge the Church's practices, and ensuring a fair trial on German soil.",

Cardinal Cajetan's approach was to offer Luther a way out of his difficulties if he simply submitted to the pope's authority and retracted his errors. This approach was direct and authoritative, as evidenced by Cajetan's insistence that Luther leave his presence and not return until he was ready to recant, highlighting a confrontational stance with no room for negotiation: \"A fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of three days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return until he was ready to recant.\"\n\nIn contrast, Carl von Miltitz estimated that the populace was largely on Luther's side and recognized that the time for forcibly suppressing him had passed. His approach was to use diplomacy to resolve the situation. Miltitz aimed to rectify Cajetan's \"blundering\" by persuading Luther to have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further attacks in the meantime. This approach was more conciliatory and aimed at finding a middle ground that would avoid escalating the conflict: \"Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further attack in the meantime.\"\n\nLuther's conditions for his compliance with Miltitz's proposal were based on reciprocity. He agreed to the terms proposed by Miltitz, but only on the condition that his opponents would also remain silent: \"Luther agreed, but only on the condition that his opponents would remain silent too.\" This condition indicates Luther's desire for a fair and balanced approach to the dispute, ensuring that neither side would further inflame the situation while a resolution was being sought.",

                                    "text": "The events described in the chapter reflect the broader historical context of tension between German nationalism and papal authority through several key points:\n\n1. **Economic Exploitation**: The sale of indulgences, particularly under the campaign led by John Tetzel, was seen as a financial burden on the German people, contributing to the perception of the Roman Church's exploitation of German finances. This is evident from the text: \"Gradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences to offset purgatorial punishment.\" This practice was not only a theological issue for Luther but also a matter of economic exploitation, which fueled resentment among the Germans.\n\n2. **Political Interference**: The involvement of the Pope in the affairs of the German states, such as the appointment of Albert of Brandenburg as the Archbishop of Mainz in exchange for financial payments, is an example of the papal interference in what were considered German national affairs. The text states, \"Pope Leo X was willing to overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats,\" highlighting the political maneuvering that was resented by many Germans.\n\n3. **Cultural and National Identity**: The rallying of Germans around Luther's theses and the growing dislike of the indulgence system reflect a burgeoning sense of German national identity that opposed the dominating attitude of a foreign power, in this case, the papacy. The text mentions, \"There had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own national affairs.\"\n\n4. **Support from German Nobility**: The support Luther received from Frederick the Wise, the Elector of Saxony, underscores the tension between German princes and the papacy. Frederick's decision to protect Luther and demand a fair trial on German soil, as opposed to handing him over to the Roman authorities, signifies the defiance of German nobility against papal authority. This is highlighted when Frederick \"prevailed upon the pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in Augsburg.\"\n\n5. **Public Opinion and National Sentiment**: The widespread distribution and favorable reception of Luther's theses among the German populace indicate a collective national sentiment that was critical of the papacy's practices and authority. The text notes, \"Within two weeks they were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany,\" showing the rapid spread and acceptance of Luther's ideas as a form of resistance against papal authority.\n\nIn summary, the events described in the chapter mirror the broader historical context of tension between German nationalism and papal authority by highlighting the economic, political, cultural, and social factors that contributed to the growing discontent with the Roman Church's influence over German affairs.",

It was at this point that Luther's theology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift, but indulgences implied that man can earn grace.\nIn 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric of Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg. Because of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable investment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to be a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before negotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.\nAlbert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg.

                    "text": "John Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel. Luther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him indulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard on the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to Rome.\nThe theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration of revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to theologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence situation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.\nThe points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but merely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther maintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong experience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome sinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties which the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the departed and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.\nLuther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by attempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he thought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the theses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were applauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.\nThere had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own national affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for those who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but also for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power. Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector Frederick stood by his daring young monk.\nAs the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the cause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to enable him to publish some theses of his own.\nWhen the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students at Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire. Luther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased by their sophomoric act.\nLuther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded them to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a row between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther with heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther received notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.\nBy no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector Frederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at least have the benefit of impartial judges.\nOn second thought the pope decided not to wait sixty days and ordered the elector to arrest Luther at once and turn him over to Cardinal Cajetan for delivery in Rome. Although Frederick was not sympathetic to heresy he was determined that the man who had brought so much attention to his university at Wittenberg should have fair play. He prevailed upon the pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in Augsburg where he would be attending a diet or parliament.\nIn a benign manner the cardinal offered to help Luther out of all his difficulty if he would simply submit to the pope's authority and retract his errors. Luther of course refused and tried to defend his positions. A fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of three days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return until he was ready to recant.\nThe cardinal was quite upset by the Augsburg incident and wrote Elector Frederick a letter calling upon him to turn the heretical monk over to the Roman authorities. Frederick's reply indicated his increasing resistance to papal dictatorship. He asked for a free trial and a statement of Luther's errors in writing.\nThe pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, was dispatched to Germany in an attempt to rectify Cajetan's blundering. He correctly estimated that much of the populace was on Luther's side and the time for forcibly suppressing him was past. Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further attack in the meantime. Luther agreed, but only on the condition that his opponents would remain silent too.",

Tetzel's activities were not directly aimed at Luther's parish due to Frederick the Wise's involvement in indulgence-related practices. However, Luther's parishioners still purchased indulgences from Tetzel, prompting Luther to realize the dangers of this practice. Luther then publicly challenged the sale of indulgences by posting ninety-five theses on the Castle Church door, inviting theological debate rather than outright rebellion. Luther's theses emphasized the need for true repentance as a lifelong commitment, critiquing indulgences as mere remissions of church-imposed penalties without the power to forgive sins. Despite Luther's intentions to reform rather than revolt, his theses garnered significant public support, highlighting growing discontent with the indulgence system and papal interference in German affairs. Luther's actions sparked a movement against Rome's financial exploitation and foreign dominance, with even Elector Frederick standing by him.

One key factor was the growing dislike of the indulgence system and the pope's interference in German affairs. The theses addressed these concerns and resonated with those who opposed Rome's exploitation of German finances and resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power. Additionally, Luther's theses were seen as a courageous and unrelenting attack on the abuses within the system, which garnered favorable public opinion and applause for challenging the status quo. The text also mentions that the Elector Frederick stood by Luther, further solidifying support for Luther's cause. Overall, Luther's theses provided a platform for those who were discontent with the existing practices and sought reform within the church.",

            "text": "Even while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up which drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to recant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with Rome.\nAndrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of Luther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck through the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was arranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve theses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with the theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was baiting Luther into the arena.\n\nAfter months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and with much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519. Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take the field.\nFor another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been established by Christ.\nLuther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's previous statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said, is the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.\nThe crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps if he made him synonymous with heresy....\nCraftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.\nIt was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers. The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were genuinely Christian and evangelical.\nThe spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault. This was heresy.\nLuther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make him infallible. After all, he was human.\nNow this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\nResults of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther, questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.\nLuther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church effected.\nThe controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\nGradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts, sermons, and commentaries.\n\nIn addition to the Leipzig debate, the summer of 1519 brought forth another event which was significant in Luther's life. Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was of utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently, there was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a Hapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a strong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an outlying province of Spain.\nWide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes of many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role of national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars, princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called it the Reformation.",

                            "text": "The chapter \"THE BREACH WIDENS\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a pivotal period in Luther's life, marked by escalating confrontations with the Roman Catholic Church's established doctrines and the Leipzig debate, which significantly propelled the Reformation movement.\n\nThe narrative begins with Luther's encounter with John Eck, an ambitious professor from the University of Ingolstadt, known for his debating prowess and desire to gain favor with Rome. Eck saw an opportunity in Luther's willingness to recant if proven wrong and initiated a public debate with Andrew Carlstadt of Wittenberg, eventually baiting Luther into a direct confrontation. This debate, held in Leipzig in 1519, was not just a theological dispute but a spectacle drawing attention from students and scholars alike, highlighting the deep divisions within the Christian community.\n\nDuring the debate, Eck and Luther sparred over the divine right of the pope and the interpretation of biblical texts, particularly the passage in St. Matthew concerning the \"rock\" upon which Christ would build his church. Luther's assertion that the church was built on the faith in Christ, rather than the papal authority of Peter, marked a significant departure from orthodox views.\n\nThe turning point in the debate, and arguably for Luther's role in the Reformation, came when Eck attempted to discredit Luther by associating his views with those of the condemned Bohemian reformer, John Hus. Luther's defense of Hus's views as \"genuinely Christian and evangelical\" and his bold claim that even general councils could err, underscored a radical shift towards scriptural authority over ecclesiastical authority. This stance led to Luther's views being condemned as heretical by the University of Paris, further alienating him from the Catholic Church.\n\nDespite the official condemnation, the Leipzig debate crystallized Luther's reformative views, including the limitations of papal and council authority, the supremacy of the Bible, and the concept of the Church as a community of believers beyond the Roman institution. These ideas laid the groundwork for the Reformation, challenging the very foundations of the Catholic Church.\n\nParallel to these theological developments, the chapter also touches on the political landscape of the time, particularly the election of Charles of Spain as the Holy Roman Emperor. Luther's growing prominence and the disillusionment with Charles's lack of national allegiance to Germany contributed to Luther being seen as a potential leader for not only religious but also political, intellectual, and economic freedom. This broad support base among scholars, princes, knights, and commoners underscored Luther's evolving role as a leader of the Reformation, a movement that sought to fundamentally transform the Christian faith and European society.\n\nIn summary, \"THE BREACH WIDENS\" captures a critical juncture in Martin Luther's life and the broader Christian world, where theological debates sparked a movement challenging centuries-old doctrines and practices. Through the Leipzig debate and the shifting political allegiances of the time, Luther emerged as a pivotal figure in what would become known as the Reformation, setting the stage for profound religious and societal changes.",

Eck saw an opportunity to gain renown and favor with Rome by challenging Luther's willingness to recant if someone proved his error. This challenge came in the form of a public debate with Andrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty, who had publicly supported Luther and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck through pamphlets. The text states, \"An ambitious professor at the University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with Rome.\"\n\nThe debate between Carlstadt and Eck, initially focused on their differences, shifted to target Luther's theology more directly. Eck prepared twelve theses for the debate at Leipzig, which were \"directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with the theology of Luther.\" This maneuver by Eck was a clear attempt to bait Luther into the arena, challenging him to defend his views publicly and thereby breaking his silence on the matter. The text elaborates on this by stating, \"The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was baiting Luther into the arena.\"\n\nEck's ambitions and strategic planning were instrumental in drawing Luther out to publicly defend his theological positions, leading to a significant moment in the Reformation. The debate at Leipzig, which saw Luther opposing the Roman Church's contention of primacy and asserting that councils could err, marked a pivotal point in Luther's break with the Church. Eck's role in this development was crucial, as his challenge and the circumstances of the debate forced Luther to articulate and defend his views more publicly and definitively than before.",

                                    "text": "The transition from the debate between Carlstadt and Eck to a confrontation between Luther and Eck at Leipzig occurred as a result of the debate's setup and the underlying theological disagreements that were more directly related to Luther's views than to Carlstadt's. Initially, the public debate was arranged between Andrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty and John Eck, an ambitious professor from the University of Ingolstadt. However, Eck's preparation for the debate involved drawing up a series of twelve theses \"directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with the theology of Luther.\" This indicates that Eck was aiming to engage Luther indirectly through his debate with Carlstadt, as he saw Luther's theology as the primary target. The text states, \"The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was baiting Luther into the arena,\" which directly led to Luther's involvement in the debate.\n\nThe main theological points of contention during the confrontation between Luther and Eck revolved around the divine right of the pope and the authority of general councils versus the authority of Scripture. Eck argued for the divine plan of government being a monarchy with the pope at its head, citing the passage in St. Matthew about the rock upon which Christ would build his church, interpreting it to mean that Peter, being the first pope, established papal supremacy. In contrast, Luther contended that the church was indeed a monarchy, but Christ was its head. He argued that the \"rock\" referred to in the passage was actually Peter's confession, \"Thou art the Christ,\" on which Christ built his church.\n\nThe debate reached a critical point when Eck compared Luther's arguments to those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, who had been condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. Luther responded by insisting that not all of Hus's views were heretical and that some were genuinely Christian and evangelical. This assertion led to a broader contention about the infallibility of general councils and the pope. Luther's stance that councils could err and his emphasis on the authority of Scripture over popes and councils were seen as heretical by the standards of the time. The text summarizes Luther's crystallized views following the debate: \"The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\"\n\nTherefore, the transition from the debate between Carlstadt and Eck to a confrontation between Luther and Eck was strategically initiated by Eck to challenge Luther's theology. The main points of contention centered on the authority of the pope, the interpretation of biblical passages regarding the foundation of the church, the infallibility of general councils, and the supreme authority of Scripture.",

This realization emerged through a series of discussions and confrontations during the debate, particularly with John Eck, an ambitious professor from the University of Ingolstadt.\n\n1. **Realization of Fallibility**: The turning point in Luther's realization came during his debate with Eck on the divine right of the pope. While Eck insisted on the papacy's supremacy as divinely ordained, Luther countered by emphasizing that Christ, not the pope, was the head of the church. This argument set the stage for questioning the infallibility of the pope and, by extension, the councils that supported papal supremacy. Luther's stance was further solidified when Eck accused him of heresy by drawing parallels between Luther's arguments and those of John Hus, a reformer condemned by the Council of Constance. Luther's defense that not all of Hus's views were heretical led to a broader implication that \"the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault\" and that this was considered heresy.\n\n2. **Impact on Theological Stance**: Luther's confrontation with Eck and the subsequent realization about the fallibility of ecclesiastical authorities had a profound impact on his theological stance. It led him to the conviction that \"even general councils could be unreliable\" and that his stand should be based on \"the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\" This marked a significant departure from the prevailing view that the pope and the councils were the ultimate interpreters of Christian doctrine. Luther's disillusionment with the debate's outcome, where his views were condemned as heretical by the judges at the University of Paris, further reinforced his belief in the authority of the Bible over human institutions.\n\nThe Leipzig debate, therefore, was instrumental in crystallizing Luther's views on the limitations of papal and council authority, leading him to emphasize the supremacy of the Scriptures. This shift laid the groundwork for his later actions and teachings, which would form the core of the Reformation. The debate underscored the necessity of reform within the church and highlighted the divergence between Luther's views and those of Rome, making it clear that reconciliation was unlikely. This realization not only shaped Luther's theological stance but also positioned him as a leader in the movement that would challenge the very foundations of the Roman Catholic Church.",

The judges at the University of Paris condemned Luther and his views as heretical, which was a clear indication that his ideas were not acceptable to the established church authorities. This condemnation likely solidified Luther's position as an outsider to the Roman Church's orthodoxy and underscored the unlikelihood of a reconciliation between his views and those of the church.\n\nFollowing the debate and the judgment from Paris, Luther's disappointment is palpable. He \"was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate\" because he had hoped his opinions would be accepted and lead to a reformation of the church. This disappointment did not deter him; instead, it contributed to a crystallization of his own views. He came to several key conclusions: \"The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\" These views marked a significant departure from the teachings of the Roman Church and laid the groundwork for Luther's future actions.\n\nThe judgment from Paris and the realization that his views were fundamentally different from those of Rome led Luther to understand that \"there was small chance of healing the breach\" between himself and the Roman Church. This realization did not cause him to back down; rather, it inspired him to intensify his efforts. He kept \"three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts, sermons, and commentaries,\" which indicates that the outcome of the Leipzig debate and the subsequent judgment by the University of Paris propelled Luther into a more active phase of writing and disseminating his ideas.\n\nIn summary, the judgment by the University of Paris following the Leipzig debate had a profound impact on Luther's relationship with the Roman Church and his future actions. It led to a deepening of his convictions, a realization of the fundamental differences between his views and those of the church, and an intensification of his efforts to spread his ideas, thereby setting the stage for the Reformation.",

These conclusions are outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Pope's Authority**: Luther concluded that the pope did not have absolute authority. This is evident from the text, \"The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority.\" This reflects Luther's belief that the pope, being human, was not above human weakness and thus not infallible.\n\n2. **Councils' Fallibility**: Luther also concluded that a council can err in its decisions. The text states, \"Now this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that councils could err also.\" This was a significant departure from the prevailing view that general councils were the highest earthly authority and beyond fault. Luther's realization that councils could be unreliable was a pivotal outcome of the debate.\n\n3. **Bible's Authority**: Most importantly, Luther affirmed the Bible as the highest authority, above both popes and councils. This is explicitly mentioned in the text, \"Henceforth he would take his stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\" Luther's conviction that the Scriptures were the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice was solidified through the debate.\n\n4. **Church of Christ**: These conclusions helped clarify Luther's views on the Church of Christ. He came to understand that the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world. The text states, \"The Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\" This signifies a broader, more inclusive understanding of the Church, emphasizing faith and the community of believers over institutional authority.\n\nIn summary, the Leipzig debate was instrumental in clarifying Luther's views on the authority structures within Christianity. By challenging the absolute authority of the pope, recognizing the fallibility of councils, and elevating the Bible as the supreme authority, Luther redefined his understanding of the Church of Christ as a global community of believers, guided by the Scriptures rather than by hierarchical ecclesiastical authority.",

Initially, there was \"rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France,\" indicating that the Germans had high expectations from Charles. They believed that Charles, being a Hapsburg, would \"unite them into a strong, independent nation.\" This expectation stemmed from a desire for national unity and strength, reflecting the political aspirations of the German populace at the time.\n\nHowever, the expectations from Charles were not met as anticipated. The text notes that \"the new emperor favored his Spanish mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an outlying province of Spain.\" This behavior from Charles indicated a lack of commitment to the German cause and a prioritization of his Spanish heritage and interests over those of Germany. As a result, Charles's failure to fulfill the role of a national unifier as expected by the Germans led to a shift in public support and enthusiasm towards Martin Luther.\n\nThe dissatisfaction with Charles's approach contributed to Luther's increased role and influence in Germany. The text explains that \"Wide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes of many Germans upon Luther.\" Luther's actions and the visibility he gained from his writings and the Leipzig debate positioned him as a prominent figure in the public eye. When Charles \"failed to step into the role of national figure,\" the German populace \"switched their enthusiasm to Luther.\" This shift indicates that Luther was seen as a figure who could potentially lead them to \"political, intellectual, and economic freedom,\" despite the fact that \"few understood his ideas on Christianity.\"\n\nIn summary, the election of Charles of Spain as Holy Roman Emperor impacted Luther's role and influence in Germany by creating a vacuum of leadership and unmet expectations, which, in turn, led the German populace to rally around Luther as a figure of hope for national unity and freedom. The Germans initially expected Charles to unite them into a strong, independent nation, but his failure to fulfill this role redirected their support towards Luther, who then emerged as a leader in what would be known as the Reformation.",

Firstly, the Leipzig debate was a significant event that brought Luther into the limelight. The debate showcased his views against the established church's doctrines, particularly regarding the authority of the pope and councils, and the supremacy of the Scriptures. The text mentions, \"Results of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris who condemned Luther and his views as heretical.\" Despite the condemnation, the debate helped to crystallize Luther's own views, such as the belief that \"the pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\" This public display of dissent and the clarity of his views attracted followers who were disillusioned with the current state of the church.\n\nSecondly, the disappointment with Charles of Spain as the new Holy Roman Emperor further fueled Luther's prominence and recognition as a leader. The text explains that there was initial rejoicing in Germany when Charles was named emperor, with hopes that he would unite the Germans into a strong, independent nation. However, Charles favored his Spanish heritage and neglected his German roots, treating Germany as \"an outlying province of Spain.\" This disappointment among the Germans made them look for leadership elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of these two factors, Luther's visibility and the widespread distribution of his writings, such as the Ninety-five Theses, combined with the public's disillusionment with Charles of Spain, led many Germans to view Luther as a potential leader who could guide them to not just religious but also political, intellectual, and economic freedom. The text states, \"Scholars, princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny.\" This broad base of support across different segments of society helped Luther to be seen as the leader of a significant movement.\n\nThe movement that Luther came to lead, as a result of his prominence after the Leipzig debate and the disappointment with Charles of Spain, was eventually called the Reformation. The text concludes by stating, \"Gradually Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called it the Reformation.\" This movement sought to reform the practices and beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church, leading to the establishment of Protestant churches and fundamentally changing the religious landscape of Europe.",

Initially, Luther was willing to recant his views if someone could prove his error, indicating a certain openness to correction within the existing ecclesiastical framework. However, the debate with Eck, particularly the confrontation over the divine right of the pope and the authority of general councils, catalyzed a shift in Luther's thinking towards a more radical position.\n\nDuring the debate, when Eck compared Luther's arguments to those of the condemned Bohemian reformer John Hus, Luther was forced into a defensive position. He argued that \"The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his views heretical\" and insisted that some of Hus's articles were \"genuinely Christian and evangelical.\" This moment was pivotal, as it led Luther to the realization that \"the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault.\" This was a significant departure from the prevailing view of the infallibility of the Church's highest councils and marked a clear break with orthodox Roman Catholic doctrine, which Luther himself recognized as heresy.\n\nThe debate's aftermath saw Luther's conviction deepen, leading him to the conclusion that \"even general councils could be unreliable.\" This realization pushed him towards a reliance on \"the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures,\" marking a fundamental shift in his approach to church authority and reform. The Scripture, for Luther, became the ultimate authority, above popes and councils, a stance that directly challenged the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church.\n\nThe implications of this shift were profound. Luther's disillusionment with the debate's outcome, where his views were condemned as heretical by the University of Paris, only solidified his resolve. He came to believe that \"The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\" This set of beliefs laid the groundwork for Luther's subsequent actions and teachings, which were foundational to the Reformation.\n\nLuther's realization that his views \"differed so fundamentally from those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach\" underscored the inevitability of his separation from the Roman Church. His stance against the Roman Church was no longer just a call for reform within its ranks but a radical reimagining of Christian authority and the nature of the Church itself, centered on the Scripture and the universal priesthood of all believers. This marked a decisive turn in the history of Christianity, leading to the fragmentation of Christendom and the birth of Protestantism.",

This diverse backing helped elevate Luther from a theological disputant to a figurehead of a significant historical movement. The text indicates that \"Scholars, princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny.\" This gathering of support from various segments of society underscored the widespread appeal of Luther's stance against ecclesiastical authority and his advocacy for reform, contributing to his perception as a leader capable of guiding a broad coalition.\n\nHowever, the understanding of Luther's ideas on Christianity among his supporters varied significantly. The text suggests that while many rallied to his cause, their motivations were not solely or even primarily theological. It states, \"Few understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom.\" This variation in understanding and motivation among his supporters indicates that Luther's appeal extended beyond his theological positions. Many of his followers were drawn to the potential for broader societal reforms that Luther's challenge to the established church implied, including aspirations for political, intellectual, and economic liberation. This broad, albeit not entirely theologically informed, base of support was instrumental in Luther's emergence as a leader in the Reformation, as it provided him with a robust and diverse coalition that was capable of challenging the status quo and advocating for sweeping changes across various facets of society.",

                    "text": "After months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and with much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519. Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take the field.\nFor another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been established by Christ.\nLuther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's previous statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said, is the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.\nThe crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps if he made him synonymous with heresy....\nCraftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.\nIt was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers. The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were genuinely Christian and evangelical.\nThe spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not beyond fault. This was heresy.\nLuther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make him infallible. After all, he was human.\nNow this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.\nResults of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther, questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.\nLuther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church effected.\nThe controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the community of believers throughout the world.\nGradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts, sermons, and commentaries.",

Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" describes the intense debate between John Eck and Martin Luther in Leipzig in 1519. The debate, marked by grandeur and attended by Wittenberg and Leipzig students, focused on theological issues such as grace, free will, and the divine right of the pope. Eck, a skilled debater, initially had the upper hand against Carlstadt but the audience eagerly awaited Luther's participation. Luther and Eck clashed over the pope's divine authority, with Luther asserting Christ as the head of the church. As the debate progressed, Eck resorted to underhanded tactics by associating Luther with heresy, drawing parallels to John Hus. Luther vehemently denied the accusation and defended Hus's Christian and evangelical beliefs. The debate culminated in Luther's realization that even general councils could err, leading him to prioritize the infallible Word of God over human authorities. Despite being condemned by judges in Paris, Luther's convictions regarding the Bible's supremacy over popes and councils solidified, emphasizing the universal nature of the Church of Christ. The debate ultimately reinforced Luther's resolve for reform, highlighting his unwavering commitment to his beliefs despite facing opposition and the prospect of martyrdom.",

Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was of utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently, there was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a Hapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a strong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an outlying province of Spain.\nWide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes of many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role of national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars, princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called it the Reformation.",

            "text": "Luther's attempts to interest the pope in reform had proved futile. He was likewise unsuccessful in having a general council convened to consider his propositions. Now, in the first of three great treatises, he called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state of the church.\nAppearing in August, 1520, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and prodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians are priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct of the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice and wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or in the monastery.\nNo one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists because they have erected three walls of defense, \"_First_, when pressed by the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope. _Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that no one can call a council but the pope.\"\nLuther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal before God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also a cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of \"priest\" is conferred by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the holder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.\nHe breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him in the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management in the church.\nBefore his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his second treatise, \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.\" The first had been primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It aimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the \"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system.\nThe Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace associated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be performed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church controlled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its most vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer bind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest artillery.\nHe reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants of a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free gift to the individual believer.\nIn the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as taught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted by Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make use of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.\n\nThe mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and crucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice man tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of the believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine should be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the wine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover, Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His sacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's sins are remitted if he has faith.\nMiltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther and the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write a letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his attacks on the papacy.\nIn the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his advisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who make him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, \"for through them Satan already has made much headway.\" He also assured Leo that he was an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing against him personally.\nAccompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, \"A Treatise on Christian Liberty.\" It expresses calm Christian reflection quite different from the theological conflicts which were carried forward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions which seem to be a paradox: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none,\" and \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\"\nThe first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been liberated and restored to a right relationship with God through justifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.\nThis freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates, passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to none.\"\nThe second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no less than become the servant of all.\nThe treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.\nA chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized. Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian liberty.\nOn the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to prove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies, he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather than individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this instance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where individual freedom before God was essential.\nThe papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the burning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and warned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication. Distribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome Aleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books in several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to strenuous opposition by the German people.\n\nOn December 10, probably in reprisal for a book-burning at Cologne, Melanchthon posted a notice on the Wittenberg University bulletin board inviting students and faculty to a bonfire outside the Elster gate of the city. Books on scholastic theology, and especially those works of canon law on which the pope and the Roman hierarchy based their claims to power, were tossed into the flames. Then Luther stepped forward quietly and with a prayer on his lips added the booklet containing the papal bull to the fire. He and the professors withdrew but the students made a holiday of the affair, parading and singing throughout the town and burning books of Luther's opponents.\nSignificantly, the bonfire marked the end of the sixty-day period of grace. From now on no one was to communicate with Luther or provide him with the necessities of life. In the eyes of Rome he was an outlaw.",

                            "text": "In the chapter \"Luther Explains Himself\" from Carl E. Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther,\" the narrative delves into Martin Luther's escalating confrontation with the Roman Catholic Church, highlighting his efforts to reform its practices and doctrines. Luther's journey begins with his attempts to engage the Pope and the church's hierarchy in a dialogue about reform, which ultimately proved fruitless. This failure prompts him to reach out directly to the secular rulers of the German nation through his seminal work, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,\" published in August 1520. In this treatise, Luther challenges the clergy's corruption and calls upon the laity, especially the nobility, to take responsibility for the church's moral and spiritual integrity, leveraging their Christian duty to oppose vice and wickedness.\n\nLuther criticizes the church's defensive mechanisms, which he identifies as three \"walls\" that have prevented reform: the church's claim to be beyond secular jurisdiction, the exclusive right of the Pope to interpret Scriptures, and the assertion that only the Pope can convene a council. He methodically dismantles these walls by asserting the priesthood of all believers, advocating for the individual's right to interpret Scriptures, and emphasizing the collective responsibility of Christians in church governance.\n\nFollowing this, Luther writes \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\" targeting theologians and aiming to liberate Christian practices from the Roman sacramental system. He disputes the church's monopoly over dispensing grace through the sacraments, performed exclusively by ordained priests, and argues for a reduction of the sacraments to only twoâbaptism and the Lord's Supperâbased on their institution by Christ and their promise of forgiveness.\n\nLuther's redefinition of the mass into the Lord's Supper underscores a shift from a sacrificial act performed by a priest to a communal act of faith, emphasizing the direct communion between the believer and Christ without the need for a mediating priesthood. This theological stance not only challenges the church's control over grace but also its financial exploitation through the sale of indulgences.\n\nAttempting to reconcile with Pope Leo X, Luther writes a letter assuring the Pope that his criticisms are not personal but directed at the corrupt system. Alongside this letter, he sends his \"Treatise on Christian Liberty,\" which contrasts theological conflicts with a message of Christian freedom and service. Despite these efforts, Pope Leo had already excommunicated Luther, a fact Luther responds to by publicly burning the papal bull, an act symbolizing his break with the church and marking him as an outlaw by Rome.\n\nThe chapter meticulously outlines Luther's theological arguments, his strategic appeals to different audiences, and the dramatic actions that culminated in his excommunication and outlaw status. Through these developments, Luther emerges not just as a theologian but as a revolutionary figure challenging the ecclesiastical and social order of his time, advocating for a Christianity rooted in individual faith and direct relationship with God, free from the mediating and often corrupting influence of the institutional church.",

This challenge to the clergy was based on the premise that all Christians, including the laity, have a responsibility towards the church and should not tolerate vice and wickedness, whether \"on the main street or in the monastery.\"\n\n2. **Demolition of the Clergy's Defenses**: Luther identified and dismantled what he described as the three walls of defense that the clergy used to maintain their authority and avoid reform.

He argued against the notion that the church controlled the flow of grace from God, which was a fundamental aspect of Catholicism's power. By doing so, Luther aimed to dismantle the church's ability to bind its subjects through its sacramental system. \n\nHe reiterated his views on the priesthood of all believers, stating that priests should serve the people who comprise the church rather than a papal hierarchy, and emphasized that grace is a free gift from God to the individual believer, not something that can be mediated or interfered with by priests. \n\nFurthermore, Luther asserted that there are only two sacramentsâbaptism and the Lord's Supperâinstead of the seven sacraments taught in Roman Catholicism. He defined a sacrament as something instituted by Christ, containing a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and involving an earthly element (water, bread, wine). By these criteria, he rejected confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction as sacraments, arguing that they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.\n\nThrough these arguments, Luther aimed to liberate the Christian fellowship in Europe from the \"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system, challenging the church's authority and doctrinal claims over the dispensation of grace and the nature of sacraments.",

Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also a cobbler differs from a blacksmith.\" He further elaborated that the title of \"priest\" is conferred by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God, thereby asserting that church officials are not beyond the reach of temporal government and should not claim superiority over other Christians.\n\nRegarding how priests should serve the people, Luther believed that priests should act as servants to the congregation, rather than serving a papal hierarchy. He emphasized that priests cannot interfere with grace, as it is \"God's free gift to the individual believer.\" This perspective was part of Luther's broader critique of the Roman Church's sacramental system, which he saw as a mechanism by which the church claimed to control the flow of grace from God to the believers, a control he vehemently opposed. Luther's stance was that the priesthood of all believers meant that every Christian had the right and responsibility to access God's message in the Scriptures directly and to participate in the management of the church, thereby democratizing religious practice and authority.\n\nIn summary, Luther's views on the priesthood of believers were centered on the equality of all Christians before God and the idea that priests should serve the people as facilitators of their direct relationship with God, rather than acting as intermediaries who control access to divine grace.",

Instead, he maintained that \"while Christ is really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the wine blood.\" This stance directly challenges the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which holds that the bread and wine used in the Eucharist become the body and blood of Christ, while retaining their appearances of bread and wine.\n\nFurthermore, Luther argued against the concept of the mass as a mechanism by which humans attempt to earn grace through the repeated sacrifice of Christ. He asserted that \"Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated.\" Instead, he emphasized that \"His sacrifice on the cross was for all time\" and that through this singular sacrifice, a man's sins are remitted if he has faith. This perspective shifts the focus from the ritualistic repetition of Christ's sacrifice to the enduring significance of the original event on the cross, highlighting the sufficiency of Christ's one-time sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.",

In the letter, Luther assured Pope Leo X that his criticisms were not personal attacks against the Pope himself but were directed at the practices and doctrines of the papacy that he found to be corrupt or misleading. Luther cautioned Leo X against listening to advisers who would elevate the Pope above councils and make him the sole authority in interpreting Scripture, warning that \"through them Satan already has made much headway.\" He also expressed his obedience to the church, clarifying that his criticisms were not aimed at Leo X personally but were against the system that he believed was being manipulated by others for corrupt purposes.\n\nLuther's letter to Leo X, accompanied by his pamphlet \"A Treatise on Christian Liberty,\" highlighted his theological stance and his desire for reform within the church. However, the letter and the treatise had little effect on Pope Leo X, as he had already signed a bull excommunicating Luther five months prior to receiving Luther's letter. This indicates that despite Luther's attempt to clarify his position and seek a peaceful resolution through his letter, the gap between his views and the stance of the papacy had become too wide to bridge, leading to his eventual excommunication.",

The first proposition is: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none.\" This statement reflects Luther's belief in the liberating power of God's grace, which frees a Christian from the consequences of sin and all earthly constraints that hinder a direct relationship with God. Through justifying grace and Christ's atonement, a Christian is liberated and restored to a right relationship with God, making him \"subject to none\" because his freedom is based on a personal relationship with God that no one can interfere with.\n\nThe second proposition counters the first by stating: \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\" This reflects the transformative effect of Christian freedom, where the liberated individual, out of gratitude for his own freedom and motivated by love, serves others. This service is not driven by mere humanitarian concerns but is a sincere effort to help others achieve the same freedom. The reborn person, now concerned not with himself but with his neighbor, becomes \"the servant of all\" as an expression of love and a desire to assist in the liberation of others.\n\nTogether, these propositions illustrate Luther's nuanced understanding of Christian freedom and service. Freedom in Christ is not an end in itself but leads to a life of service. This duality underscores the belief that true Christian liberty involves both a profound personal liberation from sin and an equally profound commitment to serving others out of love and gratitude.",

Despite this, Luther wrote a \"fiery epistle denouncing it and Eck,\" showing his immediate reaction to challenge the accusations and the system behind them (the Roman Church's authority and doctrinal positions) rather than targeting individuals with personal animosity.\n\nSecondly, Luther's decision to write a \"friendly letter to the pope\" in November, after receiving the papal bull, accompanied by his treatise on Christian liberty, further illustrates his consistent approach. The text explains, \"On the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to prove he was being consistent.\" This action demonstrates Luther's distinction between his opposition to the systemâthe autocracy of the papacy and its doctrinesâand his personal feelings towards individuals within that system, including Pope Leo X himself. He maintained a respectful tone towards the pope, cautioning him against the advice of his counselors and asserting his position as an \"obedient servant of the church,\" not inveighing against Leo personally.\n\nLastly, the text clarifies Luther's perspective on his battle: \"Although he knew he had personal enemies, he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather than individuals.\" This is further evidenced by his actions following the distribution of the papal bull, where he continued to express his views and challenge the church's doctrines, culminating in the symbolic act of burning the papal bull and other works supporting the church's claims to power. This act was not just a rejection of the bull but a broader denouncement of the system it represented.\n\nIn summary, Luther's actionsâfrom his immediate response to the bull, his continued respectful communication with the pope, to his public denouncement of the church's doctrinesâdemonstrate a consistent focus on challenging the system of the Roman Church's authority and practices, rather than engaging in personal vendettas against individuals within that system.",

Now, in the first of three great treatises, he called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state of the church.\nAppearing in August, 1520, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and prodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians are priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct of the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice and wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or in the monastery.\nNo one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists because they have erected three walls of defense, \"_First_, when pressed by the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope. _Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that no one can call a council but the pope.\"\nLuther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal before God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also a cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of \"priest\" is conferred by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the holder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.\nHe breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him in the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management in the church.\nBefore his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his second treatise, \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.\" The first had been primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It aimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the \"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system.\nThe Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace associated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be performed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church controlled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its most vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer bind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest artillery.\nHe reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants of a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free gift to the individual believer.\nIn the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as taught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted by Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make use of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.",

By disputing this belief, Luther was targeting a crucial aspect of Catholicism, as without its sacramental system, Rome would lose its control over its followers. Luther emphasized the priesthood of all believers and argued that priests should serve the people rather than a papal hierarchy. Additionally, Luther asserted his views on the number of sacraments, stating that there are only two sacramentsâbaptism and the Lord's Supperâcontrary to the seven taught in Roman Catholicism.",

Luther also emphasized that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for the right management in the church. This is evident in the text when it states, \"Luther held it was incumbent upon them and particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct of the church within their domains... He breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him in the Scriptures... Luther reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants of a papal hierarchy.\"",

                    "text": "The mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and crucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice man tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of the believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine should be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the wine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover, Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His sacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's sins are remitted if he has faith.\nMiltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther and the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write a letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his attacks on the papacy.\nIn the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his advisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who make him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, \"for through them Satan already has made much headway.\" He also assured Leo that he was an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing against him personally.\nAccompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, \"A Treatise on Christian Liberty.\" It expresses calm Christian reflection quite different from the theological conflicts which were carried forward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions which seem to be a paradox: \"A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none,\" and \"A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\"\nThe first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been liberated and restored to a right relationship with God through justifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.\nThis freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates, passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is \"subject to none.\"\nThe second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no less than become the servant of all.\nThe treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.\nA chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized. Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian liberty.\nOn the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to prove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies, he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather than individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this instance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where individual freedom before God was essential.\nThe papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the burning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and warned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication. Distribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome Aleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books in several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to strenuous opposition by the German people.",

Koppenhaver, the focus shifts to the transformation of the mass into the Lord's Supper according to Luther's beliefs. Previously viewed as a reenactment of Christ's sacrifice by a priest, the mass is now seen as a communion between the believer and Christ. Luther emphasizes the importance of both bread and wine for the communicant. He rejects the concept of transubstantiation, stating that while Christ is truly present in the elements, they do not physically transform into his flesh and blood. Luther clarifies that Christ's sacrifice on the cross was definitive and eternal, not to be repeated in the mass. The forgiveness of sins is granted through faith in Christ's sacrifice, not through the mass. Additionally, the paragraph briefly mentions Miltitz's attempt to reconcile Luther with the pope in 1520, Luther's letter to Leo X emphasizing his obedience to the church, and the publication of his pamphlet \"A Treatise on Christian Liberty,\" which discusses the paradoxical nature of Christian freedom and servitude.",

Additionally, Luther emphasized that priests should be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants of a papal hierarchy, and that they cannot interfere with grace, which is God's free gift to the individual believer. \n\nThis can be supported by the following excerpt from the text: \"In the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as taught in Roman Catholicism...Confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.\"",

Luther believed that this system hindered individual believers' direct relationship with God and placed undue authority in the hands of the church hierarchy. He aimed to dismantle this system by emphasizing the priesthood of all believers and rejecting the Roman Catholic teaching on sacraments beyond baptism and the Lord's Supper. Luther stated that the sacraments had to be instituted by Christ, contain a promise of forgiveness of sins, and use earthly elements. By challenging the Roman sacramental system, Luther sought to restore the freedom of individual believers and reduce the church's control over their spiritual lives.",

Luther believed that all Christians, regardless of their vocation, had a duty to ensure the church's proper functioning and adherence to God's teachings. He argued that priests should serve the people within the church rather than a papal hierarchy and that every individual, as a priest, shared responsibility for the church's management.\n\nThis emphasis on the priesthood of all believers was crucial in advocating for a more egalitarian approach within the church and diminishing the authority of the papal hierarchy. Luther's stance aimed to decentralize power within the church and promote a more inclusive and participatory role for all Christians in its governance and spiritual life.\n\nIn Luther's words, \"He breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him in the Scriptures\" and \"every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management in the church.\" This highlights Luther's belief in the equal spiritual standing of all Christians and their collective responsibility for the church's affairs, thereby challenging the traditional notions of hierarchy and exclusivity within the church.",

Then Luther stepped forward quietly and with a prayer on his lips added the booklet containing the papal bull to the fire. He and the professors withdrew but the students made a holiday of the affair, parading and singing throughout the town and burning books of Luther's opponents.\nSignificantly, the bonfire marked the end of the sixty-day period of grace.

            "text": "Overtones of intrigue and statecraft are dominant in the prelude to the imperial assembly at Worms. The church at Rome had given its decision. Would the secular authorities now take action and turn him over to the papal authorities?\n\nCharles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial constitution which said no German should be taken outside his country for trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing. Frederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using these same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative, wanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well aware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man had been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the rulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further examination of his views.\nFor the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to transacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed his mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing. Finally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct to Worms.\nIn a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from Wittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him to preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms. When the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on April 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the city gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther was barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St. John.\nHe was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and because of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and alleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door of the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On it sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table loaded with books.\nAfter the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer, an official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked Luther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had written.\nLuther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions and was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could not be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that the titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.\nAgain the question, \"Will you retract...?\"\nThe monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's Word. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\" Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.\nAfter a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but this time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or are you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it. They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was impossible.\nThe books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against individuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and intemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the fires.\nObviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther. \"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not recant your errors?\"\nThe Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.\n\"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will answer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.\nThe spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to all corners of the room.\n\"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against conscience. God help me! Amen.\"\nThere was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.\nCharles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.\nHaving received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.",

Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a pivotal moment in the Protestant Reformation, capturing the tension and drama surrounding Martin Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms in 1521. The narrative begins with the backdrop of political and religious intrigue, highlighting the pressures from the Roman Church for the secular authorities, particularly Emperor Charles V and Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, to take decisive action against Luther following his excommunication. Despite the church's condemnation, Luther's journey to Worms is marked by widespread public support, underscoring his growing influence and the contentious atmosphere of the time.\n\nUpon his arrival in Worms, Luther is met with an overwhelming reception, indicating the significant public interest in his case. The detailed account of his appearance before the Diet, under the watchful eyes of Emperor Charles V, the nobility, and ecclesiastical authorities, sets the stage for a dramatic confrontation. Luther is asked to recant his writings, which he categorizes into three groups: devotional works, criticisms of the papacy, and personal attacks. He admits to harsh language in the latter but stands firm on the content of his works, refusing to recant unless convinced by Scripture or sound reason.\n\nLuther's bold stance, encapsulated in his famous declaration that he cannot act against his conscience, marks a defining moment in the Reformation. The immediate aftermath of his refusal sees a mix of chaos and admiration, with Luther gaining further support among the nobles and the public. However, the political complexities of the situation are evident in Emperor Charles V's deliberations with the electors and princes on how to proceed, balancing the desire to condemn Luther with the need for German support in other matters.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the issuance of the Edict of Worms, declaring Luther an outlaw and demanding his capture. This edict represents the culmination of the Diet's proceedings and sets the stage for the next phase of Luther's struggle and the broader Reformation movement. Through this detailed account, Koppenhaver captures the intricate interplay of religion, politics, and personal conviction that defined Luther's stand at Worms, a stand that would have lasting implications for Christianity and European history.",

Luther was ushered into the assembly hall, where he found himself in the presence of an impressive gathering that included princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics, with the young Emperor Charles seated on a canopied chair. A table loaded with books was situated nearby. The presiding officer, an official of the archbishop of Trier, initiated the proceedings by pointing to the books on the table, asking Luther two key questions: if he was the author of the books and if he was ready to retract what he had written.\n\nLuther's response to this initial inquiry was cautious and measured. He had been advised to speak only in answer to direct questions and avoid seeking a discussion. The dual nature of the question presented to himâconcerning his authorship of the books and his willingness to retract themâdid not allow for a simple yes or no answer. Recognizing this, Luther's legal adviser requested that the titles of the books be read out. After the titles were read, Luther acknowledged that the books were indeed his.\n\nWhen pressed again with the question, \"Will you retract...?\" Luther expressed his belief that his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's Word. He recalled Christ's admonition to the disciples about the consequences of denying Him before men, which underscored the gravity of the situation for Luther, as he believed his salvation was at stake. Given the weight of the decision, he requested time to consider his answer. The diet granted him this request, agreeing that he should return at four the next afternoon to provide his response.\n\nThus, Luther's response during his first appearance was to acknowledge authorship of the books while seeking additional time to contemplate the request for retraction, highlighting his deep concern for the integrity of his convictions and the implications of his response on his faith and salvation.",

The text describes how the interrogator attempted to restore order, but Emperor Charles eventually walked out, leading to the adjournment of the meeting. This tumultuous response within the assembly highlights the contentious nature of Luther's stance and the polarized atmosphere of the Diet.\n\nIn contrast, the reaction of the populace to Luther's statement and stance was overwhelmingly positive. Luther was \"escorted back to his rooms by the admiring populace,\" indicating widespread public support for him among the people present. This admiration from the public suggests that Luther's refusal to recant resonated with many, bolstering his image as a courageous and principled figure.\n\nFurthermore, Luther's unwavering stance and the public's reaction positively affected his support among the nobles. The text notes that nobles who had previously been on the fringe \"now openly praised the courageous preacher and vowed their support.\" This shift in the nobles' stance indicates that Luther's firmness in the face of potential condemnation, combined with the public's favorable reaction, encouraged more nobles to openly align themselves with him. Their vows of support signify a significant bolstering of Luther's position, suggesting that his resolve and the public's backing were instrumental in swaying the nobility's opinion in his favor.\n\nIn summary, Luther's final statement at the Diet of Worms elicited a mixed reaction from the assembly and a highly positive response from the populace, which, in turn, significantly enhanced his support among the nobles.",

After the diet officially closed on May 25, a \"rump session of prejudiced nobles\" convened the next day, leading to the emperor signing the Edict of Worms.

                    "text": "Charles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial constitution which said no German should be taken outside his country for trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing. Frederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using these same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative, wanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well aware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man had been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the rulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further examination of his views.\nFor the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to transacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed his mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing. Finally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct to Worms.\nIn a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from Wittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him to preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms. When the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on April 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the city gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther was barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St. John.\nHe was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and because of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and alleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door of the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On it sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table loaded with books.\nAfter the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer, an official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked Luther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had written.\nLuther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions and was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could not be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that the titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.\nAgain the question, \"Will you retract...?\"\nThe monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's Word. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples \"whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father....\" Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.\nAfter a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but this time phrased a bit differently. \"Do you defend all of your books or are you willing to recall some things?\" This was the opening Luther had been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it. They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was impossible.\nThe books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against individuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and intemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the fires.\nObviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther. \"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not recant your errors?\"\nThe Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.\n\"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will answer without horns or teeth,\" he began quietly.\nThe spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to all corners of the room.\n\"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against conscience. God help me! Amen.\"\nThere was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.\nCharles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.\nHaving received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.",

            "text": "Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a \"kidnapping\" and removal to a safe place was planned.\nLuther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit relatives at MÃ¶hra. For months the outside world knew only that he had been captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights. Many lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to his adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed their fears.\nBy a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an ancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the exception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did not leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George, a carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side. The secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who authorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.\nLuther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to contemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel? Could a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error and drag many others to eternal damnation?\nHard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the Magnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well underway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.\nPrayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain silent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With conviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him back into the world again he went courageously and with determination. He was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what took him back to Wittenberg.\nSo often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was no exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from bondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly procedure.\nIn parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs, paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in the traditional forms were attacked.\nRumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise of Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December, 1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which they later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a \"warning against riot and rebellion,\" written on his return to the Wartburg.\nIn it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of faith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart of a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in God--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works. Giving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as the spiritual attitude of the communicant.\nFinally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522. Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.\nThe peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of bloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they adapted Luther's \"free lord of all\" statement to their own demands for social reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to lawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally defeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.\nWittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian nunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the local university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the Black Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were Artist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle Church; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....\nIf there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been announced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to appear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and slanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The malicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with a special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister, and a dance at the town hall on June 27.\nThe wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace. Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but marriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at the age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.\n\nShe and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan of escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him personally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in empty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes, husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking. Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which he had urged on so many others.\nIt was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\nMarriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years. Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.\nThe vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be imagined by his reference to her as \"my lord Kathie.\" She was an efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.\nThings improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home, and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the university.\n\nThe Luthers had six children. Two of them died in childhood, but otherwise the family enjoyed a merry, wholesome life. The house was always full of visitors--some of them more or less permanent--including traveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns seeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among their kinsfolk. Because it was large and suitable, the cloister sometimes was used as a hospital, and it was not unusual for the \"family\" to number as many as twenty-five. Guests who stayed for any length of time were expected to take part in household duties, participate in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions. Music, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling were forms of recreation. Through Kathie's economy, improvements were made in the Luther house. An orchard, hop garden, and finally a farm were purchased.\nWhen Luther worried about his children's future he overcame it with faith. A pious training is most important, he wrote. It is good to leave an inheritance, but preparing children to manage wisely is more important. We parents are fools if we don't train them to fear God, to control themselves, and to live honorably.",

Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into a transformative period in Luther's life, marked by significant personal and societal shifts. Initially, Luther finds himself in a precarious situation, necessitating a strategic \"kidnapping\" to the Wartburg castle for safety after his safe-conduct expires. This period of forced seclusion prompts deep self-reflection and prolific writing, including the translation of the New Testament into German, signaling his unwavering commitment to reforming the church and making religious texts accessible to the common people.\n\nLuther's time at Wartburg is a crucible for his theological convictions. Despite grappling with doubt, his resolve is fortified through prayer and study, leading him to re-enter the world with a renewed sense of purpose. His return to Wittenberg is prompted by reports of radical reforms and unrest, which he perceives as deviating from the true essence of the Reformation. Luther advocates for a measured approach to reform, emphasizing internal faith over external practices, a stance that restores some order amidst the chaos.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the broader societal impact of Luther's teachings, particularly their unintended role in fueling the Peasants' War. Luther's emphasis on spiritual freedom is co-opted by the peasantry as a rallying cry for social and economic reform, leading to a violent uprising that is ultimately quashed. This dark chapter underscores the complex interplay between religious reform and social change, highlighting Luther's conservative stance on obedience to secular authority.\n\nAmidst these tumultuous events, Luther's personal life undergoes a significant transformation through his marriage to Katherine von Bora, a former nun. This union, born from a shared desire for a life beyond the monastic vows and a mutual respect for each other's convictions, marks a departure from traditional clerical celibacy and underscores Luther's belief in the sanctity and value of marriage. The couple's life together in the Black Cloister becomes a beacon of domestic and communal harmony, offering a glimpse into Luther's ideals about family, education, and community living.\n\nIn summary, the chapter \"Drastic Changes\" captures a pivotal period in Martin Luther's life and the Reformation at large. It explores Luther's internal struggles, his strategic responses to external challenges, and the profound impact of his teachings on both the church and society. Through his writings, actions, and personal life choices, Luther emerges as a figure of both revolutionary and conservative impulses, advocating for a faith-driven reform of the church while upholding the value of social order and family life.",

Initially, Luther \"chafed at his forced inactivity\" during his time at the castle, which led him to deep contemplation and self-examination. He questioned the validity of past generations and scholars in comparison to the gospel and pondered over the possibility of his own error, which could potentially lead many to eternal damnation. This period of reflection indicates a phase of doubt and introspection about the correctness of his actions and beliefs.\n\nHowever, Luther's stay was also a period of significant productivity and reaffirmation of his convictions. To distract himself from his problems, he engaged in \"hard work,\" which included writing a work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the Magnificat, starting a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels, and notably, translating the entire New Testament into German. This work not only contributed significantly to his cause but also helped him to refocus and solidify his beliefs.\n\nPrayer and study during his time at the castle \"restored his conviction.\" Luther concluded that to doubt or remain silent was akin to going against conscience, which was \"neither right nor safe.\" This realization led him to feel a sense of divine commission, emboldening him with courage and determination to return to the world and continue his revolutionary, yet conservative, efforts in reform.\n\nThus, Luther's stay at the Wartburg Castle, under the guise of Junker George, was a critical period that allowed him to reflect, produce significant theological works, and ultimately reaffirm and strengthen his convictions, which fueled his subsequent actions in the Reformation movement.",

He pondered, \"Could past generations and earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel? Could a mere friar be right against them all?

He believed that \"men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace.\" This perspective directly influenced Katherine von Bora and other nuns, leading them to seek Luther's assistance in escaping the convent. His teachings had found their way into many cloisters and convents, including Nimbschen, where Katherine was received into the Cistercian Order. This demonstrates how Luther's views on faith and the monastic life catalyzed significant life changes for individuals like Katherine and ultimately led to his own marriage.\n\n2. **Personal Application of Teachings:** Luther's decision to marry Katherine von Bora was a direct application of his teachings. Despite his initial reluctance, he resolved to marry Katherine, reflecting his belief in marriage over celibacy. This decision was not just personal but also a public affirmation of his reformist beliefs, challenging the prevailing ecclesiastical norms and setting a precedent for others.\n\n3. **Impact on Wider Society:** Luther's marriage and the manner in which it was conductedâhighlighted by a public ceremony and a wedding dinnerâserved as a model for the new form of Christian life he advocated. This event, along with his teachings, contributed to the broader societal shift towards questioning the traditional ecclesiastical structures and embracing reforms in religious practices and personal life choices.\n\n4. **Contribution to the Reformation Movement:** Luther's teachings and his marriage to Katherine von Bora were emblematic of the broader Reformation movement, which sought to align Christian practices more closely with the teachings of the Bible rather than with church tradition. His stance on issues like celibacy, monastic vows, and the importance of faith over works influenced not only his personal life but also the direction of the Reformation, encouraging a return to scriptural foundations in both belief and practice.\n\nIn summary, Luther's teachings on faith and reform were pivotal in leading up to his marriage to Katherine von Bora and had a lasting impact following their union, influencing both their personal lives and the broader societal and religious landscape.",

Luther's teachings criticized the monastic system and the requirement of celibacy for clergy, arguing that these practices were not founded on Scripture but rather on human tradition. He believed that men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace. Specifically, the text states, \"He disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace. Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but marriage is.\"\n\nLuther's marriage to Katherine von Bora, a former nun, was a direct manifestation of these beliefs. By marrying, Luther and von Bora both rejected the monastic vows they had previously taken, thereby embodying Luther's teaching that marriage was a valid and scripturally supported life choice for those who had been in religious orders. The text elaborates on this point by noting, \"The wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings.\"\n\nFurthermore, the circumstances leading up to their marriage underscore Luther's commitment to these ideals. Katherine von Bora and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance to escape the convent, which they successfully did with his help. This act of facilitating their escape and later marrying von Bora demonstrated Luther's practical application of his teachings against the monastic life and celibacy. The text describes how, after aiding in their escape, \"Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which he had urged on so many others.\"\n\nIn summary, Luther's marriage to Katherine von Bora exemplified his teachings on monasticism and celibacy by acting out the belief that marriage is scripturally supported and preferable to vows of celibacy and the monastic life. Their marriage was a tangible rejection of the monastic system and an affirmation of Luther's view that faith and grace, rather than vows and restraints, should be the foundation of a Christian's life.",

First, her efficient housekeeping and management brought order to Luther's previously disorganized living conditions. Before Katherine, Luther's existence was described as irregular, with \"dishes covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made in over a year, his clothes were in disorder,\" and his eating habits were erratic. Katherine's arrival transformed this chaos into an ordered environment, which likely contributed to Luther's ability to focus on his work and maintain better health. This change is encapsulated in Luther's own words: \"Formerly at the table I was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\n\nMoreover, Katherine's role as a \"thrifty manager\" of their household finances was crucial, especially considering that Luther \"refused pay for his writing\" and did not receive any tax revenues from the cloister after laying aside his cowl. Her management skills helped stabilize their financial situation, allowing Luther to continue his work without the added stress of financial instability. This is further evidenced by the improvements made to their home under Katherine's management, including the acquisition of a vegetable garden, a small brew house, an orchard, hop garden, and a farm.\n\nKatherine's influence also extended to the broader social environment of their home, which became a lively and welcoming place for visitors, including \"traveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns seeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among their kinsfolk.\" The home's atmosphere, characterized by daily prayers, catechetical study, family devotions, and recreational activities like music, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling, reflected the values and priorities of the Reformation movement that Luther led. This environment not only supported Luther's work but also served as a practical example of the principles he preached.\n\nLastly, Katherine's management of the household and her role in Luther's life had a personal impact on Luther, as it is suggested that marriage \"probably extended Luther's life for a number of years.\" This implies that the stability, care, and companionship Katherine provided contributed to Luther's well-being and longevity, enabling him to continue his work for a longer period.\n\nIn summary, Katherine von Bora's management of the household significantly impacted Martin Luther's life and work by providing a stable and organized home environment, managing their finances effectively, creating a welcoming and value-driven social environment, and contributing to Luther's personal well-being and longevity.",

He believed that \"Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but marriage is.\" This belief led him to marry Katherine von Bora, and together they exemplified a Christian household based on mutual support, faith, and grace rather than monastic restraints and vows. Their marriage was \"a direct result of Luther's reform teachings,\" showcasing his belief in the sanctity and importance of marriage as per Christian doctrine.\n\nThe Luthers' approach to hospitality and their open house policy reflected Luther's teachings on community and service. Their home was \"always full of visitors--some of them more or less permanent--including traveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns seeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among their kinsfolk.\" This open-door policy was a practical application of Luther's belief in Christian duty and service to others. The inclusion of guests in household duties, daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions further emphasized the importance of a communal faith life, aligning with Luther's emphasis on the importance of faith in everyday actions.\n\nMoreover, the Luthers' family life was marked by a balance of discipline and joy, reflecting Luther's teachings on the importance of a pious upbringing. He believed that \"A pious training is most important,\" and that it was crucial to prepare children to \"fear God, to control themselves, and to live honorably.\" This belief was lived out in the Luther household through the integration of music, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling as forms of wholesome recreation, alongside the more serious aspects of religious and moral education.\n\nIn summary, the Luthers' approach to family life and hospitality was a direct reflection of Martin Luther's beliefs and teachings, emphasizing the importance of marriage, community, service, and a pious, disciplined yet joyful upbringing within a Christian framework.",

The text mentions, \"Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a 'kidnapping' and removal to a safe place was planned.\" This indicates that Luther's actions had already set him against powerful adversaries, a hallmark of a revolutionary.\n   - His prolific work during his stay in the Wartburg, including translating the entire New Testament into German, demonstrates his commitment to making religious texts accessible to the common people, a revolutionary act that challenged the Church's control over religious interpretation. \"During his stay in the Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored...and had translated the entire New Testament into German.\"\n   - Luther's return to Wittenberg in defiance of the imperial ban further underscores his revolutionary character. \"Finally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522.\"\n\n2. **Conservative Aspect:**\n   - Despite his revolutionary actions, Luther's approach to reform was marked by a desire for order and restraint. The text highlights his conservative nature in his reaction to the zealots' actions during the Reformation: \"So often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was no exception in this respect.\" Luther cautioned against riot and rebellion, advocating for reform as a matter of faith rather than through violent upheaval.\n   - His insistence that no drastic change should be made until those affected requested it as a matter of faith shows his conservative approach to reform. He believed in re-education and gradual change rather than immediate, radical transformation. \"Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.\"\n   - Luther's personal life, particularly his marriage and family life, also reflects conservative values. He promoted the idea of marriage and family as foundational to society, a stance that aligns with conservative principles. \"Marriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years...The Luthers had six children...The house was always full of visitors...Guests who stayed for any length of time were expected to take part in household duties, participate in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions.\"\n\nIn summary, Luther's character as both a revolutionary and a conservative is illustrated through his bold actions against the established Church and his advocacy for reform, balanced by his emphasis on order, gradual change, and the importance of family and societal stability.",

These changes were marked by a departure from traditional rituals and the adoption of new practices that aligned more closely with Luther's teachings. For example, \"organs, paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in the traditional forms were attacked.\" This indicates a radical shift from established religious norms, reflecting Luther's emphasis on faith over works and the direct relationship between the individual and God, without the mediation of the church's traditional sacramental system.\n\n2. **Peasants' Uprisings**: Luther's teachings also had unintended social consequences, particularly evident in the peasants' uprisings. The peasants, \"chafing under their bondage to the nobles,\" interpreted Luther's concept of being \"free lord of all\" as a theological justification for their demands for social reform. This led to a series of \"bloody uprisings\" where the peasants \"ravaged and plundered until finally defeated in 1525.\" Luther's response to these uprisings was to preach \"the Christian duty of submission to lawful authority,\" which highlights a complex relationship between his teachings and the social upheavals of the time. While his theological ideas provided a framework for questioning established authority, including that of the church, Luther himself did not support the violent overthrow of secular authority, viewing such actions as contrary to Christian duty.\n\nThese consequences illustrate the dual nature of Luther's impact on Germany. On one hand, his teachings facilitated a reevaluation of church practices, leading to significant religious reforms that aligned more closely with his interpretation of the Bible and the early Christian church. On the other hand, the same teachings indirectly inspired social unrest among the peasants, leading to uprisings that were met with Luther's disapproval. This complex legacy underscores the transformative yet tumultuous effect of Luther's Reformation on the social and religious landscape of Germany.",

He believed that \"men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace.\" This belief led to his marriage, which was founded on the scriptural endorsement of marriage over celibacy. His personal life thus became a testament to his teachings, as he practiced what he preached by marrying a former nun, thereby embodying the reformative shift from celibacy to marriage.\n\n2. **Simplicity and Piety in Family Life**: Luther's family life was characterized by simplicity, piety, and communal living, which reflected his broader theological emphasis on faith and grace over works. The Luthers' household was always full, not just with their own children but with visitors, relatives, and orphans, turning it into a community that lived out the principles of Luther's reforms. They engaged in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions, emphasizing the importance of a pious upbringing over material inheritance. Luther believed in \"preparing children to manage wisely\" and to \"fear God, to control themselves, and to live honorably,\" which mirrored his broader theological emphasis on faith and personal piety.\n\n3. **Economic Management and Thrift**: The management of the Luther household under Katherine's direction, described as efficient and thrifty, can be seen as a reflection of Luther's critique of the Church's wealth and his emphasis on a more austere, faithful way of life. Despite Luther's significant contributions to theology and the Reformation, he refused payment for his writings and lived modestly, which was in stark contrast to the opulence often associated with the Church hierarchy. The economic management of their household, including the establishment of a vegetable garden and a small brew house, showcased a self-sufficient, industrious lifestyle that aligned with Luther's calls for reform in the Church and society.\n\n4. **Community and Hospitality**: The Luther household's openness to hosting a wide array of guests, including dignitaries, monks, nuns, and orphans, reflected Luther's broader vision of a communal, inclusive Christianity. This hospitality and the communal aspect of their household life were indicative of Luther's theological emphasis on the church as a community of believers, rather than a hierarchical institution. Their practice of including guests in household duties and devotions further emphasized the importance of active faith and community in Luther's reforms.\n\nIn summary, Luther's personal life, especially his marriage and family life, served as a living example of his broader theological and social reforms. Through his rejection of celibacy, emphasis on a simple and pious family life, economic thrift, and a strong sense of community and hospitality, Luther's private life mirrored the principles he advocated for in his public and theological reforms.",

                    "text": "Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a \"kidnapping\" and removal to a safe place was planned.\nLuther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit relatives at MÃ¶hra. For months the outside world knew only that he had been captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights. Many lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to his adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed their fears.\nBy a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an ancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the exception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did not leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George, a carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side. The secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who authorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.\nLuther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to contemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel? Could a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error and drag many others to eternal damnation?\nHard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the Magnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well underway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.\nPrayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain silent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With conviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him back into the world again he went courageously and with determination. He was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what took him back to Wittenberg.\nSo often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was no exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from bondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly procedure.\nIn parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs, paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in the traditional forms were attacked.\nRumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise of Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December, 1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which they later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a \"warning against riot and rebellion,\" written on his return to the Wartburg.\nIn it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of faith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart of a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in God--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works. Giving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as the spiritual attitude of the communicant.\nFinally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522. Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.\nThe peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of bloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they adapted Luther's \"free lord of all\" statement to their own demands for social reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to lawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally defeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.\nWittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian nunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the local university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the Black Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were Artist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle Church; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....\nIf there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been announced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to appear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and slanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The malicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with a special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister, and a dance at the town hall on June 27.\nThe wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace. Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but marriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at the age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.",

Luther, under the guise of Junker George, stayed there for seven months, engaging in contemplation, self-examination, and prolific scholarly work. Despite doubts and forced inactivity, Luther's prayer, study, and hard work restored his conviction and sense of divine commission. He authored various works, including a translation of the New Testament into German. Luther's conviction led him back to Wittenberg, where he cautioned against hasty reforms and vandalism in the name of the Reformation. Despite unrest and uprisings, Luther emphasized the importance of faith over external actions and restored order in Wittenberg after his return in the face of the imperial ban. The paragraph highlights Luther's commitment to reform, his scholarly endeavors, and his cautious approach to the Reformation amidst tumultuous times.",

Luther disliked the monastic system where individuals sought merit through restraints and vows rather than relying on grace. He believed that celibacy was not based on Scripture, but marriage was. This led to changes within convents and monasteries as Luther's teachings spread, influencing individuals like Katherine von Bora who had been part of the Cistercian Order. The text states, \"He disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace... These teachings found their way into many cloisters and convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora... had been received into the Cistercian Order.\"",

The plan succeeded and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes, husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking. Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which he had urged on so many others.\nIt was strange for one accustomed to solitude. \"Formerly at the table I was alone,\" he wrote, \"now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before.\"\nMarriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years. Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.\nThe vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be imagined by his reference to her as \"my lord Kathie.\" She was an efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.\nThings improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home, and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the university.",

However, after marrying Kathie, his industrious wife, order was established in their home. Luther referred to her as \"my lord Kathie,\" highlighting her efficient housekeeping and thrifty management of their household. She played a significant role in improving their living conditions and managing their limited resources. Additionally, Luther's marriage to Kathie provided him with companionship and a sense of family life that he had not experienced before. He remarked on the change in his daily routine, noting, \"Formerly at the table I was alone, now I am with someone.\" Furthermore, Luther's marriage to Kathie also had financial implications, as they received the cloister as a home from the elector, and Kathie managed a vegetable garden and a brew house to support their family.",

            "text": "The people at Wittenberg and in other cities of influence were gradually learning to think of the church as separate from the Roman hierarchy. Now there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was essential and arrangements had to be made for their training and support. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of endeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had lapsed into indifference.\nLuther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted him. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use he felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there had to be some sort of oversight.\nThe bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were loath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony beginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of Germany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization began.\n\nIn the meantime two distinct factions had developed among the princes of Germany. One espoused the Roman cause, the other the Reformation. From 1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts which had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the Reformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to oppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared only eight years before were becoming the national mind.\nSparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with Rome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or confession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were actually submitted.\nAs usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced the emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best ammunition for the Saxon \"heretics,\" fully confident that a Lutheran defeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.\nStill under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at a castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others appearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight articles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The first twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures regarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church, the Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin, Good Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of Roman abuses which contradict the Word of God.\nThe emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation. On the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church property restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the printing or sale of Lutheran writings.\nDejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home in the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic creed of the largest Protestant body in the world.\nThreatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with other Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was averted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish invasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was delayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months earlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead of fear.\nThe circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace, where he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died early on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing himself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.\n\nLuther's lifetime was marked with concern--concern first about himself and God. It wasn't selfish; a man has to find his treasure before he can share it. Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a monastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he found the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's revelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is love instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for himself. It is God's free gift.\nThen his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to keep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of evil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to stop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so soft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the ramparts of his mighty-fortress God.\n\"The devil prefers blockheads,\" he said, therefore, \"the school must be the next thing to the church.\" Concern led him to teach. Professor was the only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who arrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred Scriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were translated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would understand it that way too.\nThe principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the promise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount the humility of his service: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\"",

Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" delves into the transformative period of the Protestant Reformation, spearheaded by Martin Luther, and its profound impact on the Christian church and European society. As the Reformation gained momentum, the necessity for a reorganized church, distinct from the Roman hierarchy, became apparent. This reorganization involved establishing a reliable system for training and supporting ministers, creating a unified effort among congregations, and initiating mission work to rekindle faith in regions of indifference.\n\nLuther, who was not inclined towards organizational tasks, was concerned about the church becoming entangled in laws and regulations. Despite this, he recognized the urgent need for proper religious instruction for all ages, which led to the involvement of congregations and city councils in selecting pastors and establishing schools, under the guidance of visitation committees from 1527.\n\nThe political landscape of Germany at the time was divided between princes supporting the Roman Catholic cause and those favoring the Reformation. This division led to a series of diets and assemblies between 1525 and 1529, culminating in the Protest at Speyer in 1529, where Reformation princes opposed a resolution that sought to limit the spread of Luther's teachings, arguing that matters of salvation were personal and could not be legislated.\n\nThe Reformation's influence spread across Europe, leading to the emergence of various denominations. The Diet of Augsburg in 1530 was a significant attempt to reconcile these groups with Rome. Luther, unable to attend due to an imperial ban, contributed to the drafting of the Lutheran Confession, which articulated the fundamental doctrines of the Reformation. However, the emperor rejected this confession, leading to further estrangement between the Lutherans and the Roman Church.\n\nDespite initial setbacks, the Lutherans' resolve led to the formation of the League of Schmalkalden in 1531, a defensive alliance against Roman coercion. This period of relative peace was interrupted by the Turkish invasion and later by armed conflict over religious principles, which Luther did not live to see, passing away in 1546.\n\nThroughout his life, Luther was driven by a deep concern for understanding God's nature and sharing this understanding with others. His efforts to reform the church were rooted in a desire to align it more closely with the teachings of the Bible, emphasizing that God's love is a free gift, accessible to all without mediation. Luther's translation of the Bible into the vernacular and his advocacy for education and personal engagement with scripture were pivotal in democratizing religious knowledge and fostering a personal relationship with God among believers.\n\nIn summary, \"A Church Reborn\" captures the essence of Luther's role in the Reformation, highlighting his theological contributions, the political and social upheavals of the period, and his enduring legacy in shaping the Protestant faith and influencing the broader Christian tradition.",

Secondly, there was a need to establish \"a bond of some sort\" to ensure \"unity of endeavor,\" highlighting the importance of organizational unity in the face of separation from the Roman hierarchy. Lastly, \"mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had lapsed into indifference,\" pointing to the need for outreach and revitalization of faith in areas where the church's influence had weakened.

This concern is explicitly mentioned: \"The thought that the new church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted him.\" This statement underscores Luther's fear that the essence and spirit of the church could be overshadowed or lost amidst a complex framework of rules.\n\nDespite his aversion to organizational work, Luther recognized the pressing needs of the church that required immediate attention, prioritizing them over his concerns about the church becoming overly regulated. One of the most urgent matters he identified was the proper instruction of both young and old members of the church. The text states, \"Proper instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there had to be some sort of oversight.\" This indicates that Luther saw education in faith as a foundational need for the church, essential for its growth and spiritual health.\n\nTo address this need, Luther took a proactive approach by assigning the responsibility of education and pastoral care directly to the congregations and, in some cases, to the city councils. He advocated for the selection of competent men as pastors, the establishment of pastoral districts, and the setting up of schools. This strategy is detailed in the text: \"Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up schools.\" This approach not only aimed to ensure the proper instruction of the church's members but also fostered a sense of community responsibility and involvement in the church's growth and reformation.\n\nIn summary, Luther was concerned about the new church becoming entangled in laws and regulations, fearing it might lose its spiritual essence. However, he prioritized the church's immediate needs, particularly the proper instruction of its members, and advocated for a community-driven approach to address these needs, demonstrating his commitment to the church's spiritual health and unity.",

This division among the princes led to a series of diets and assemblies from 1525 to 1529, which were largely focused on the conflict between these two factions over the spread of Luther's teachings and the enforcement of the ban against him and his followers. \n\nThe text states, \"From 1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts which had been executed at Worms.\" This indicates that the political division directly influenced the Reformation by creating a platform for the debate and struggle over Luther's ideas, showcasing the conflict at a high level of governance.\n\nFurthermore, the division influenced the progression of the Reformation during the Diet of Speyer in 1529, where \"the Catholic princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the Reformation princes protested.\" The protest by the Reformation princes was a pivotal moment, as it demonstrated a unified stance against attempts to limit the spread of Reformation ideas, underscoring the political support Lutheranism had garnered among certain segments of the German nobility.\n\nThe political landscape also set the stage for the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, which aimed to harmonize the various religious groups and attempt a final reconciliation with Rome. The division among the princes was evident here as well, as the text mentions, \"As usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans.\" This environment of division and conflict provided a backdrop against which the Lutheran confession was presented, further solidifying the doctrinal positions of the Reformation in opposition to Roman Catholicism.\n\nIn summary, the division between Roman and Reformation princes in Germany significantly influenced the progression of the Reformation by creating a contentious political environment that facilitated the debate, defense, and dissemination of Reformation principles. This division not only highlighted the struggle for religious reform but also underscored the political dynamics that were crucial in the spread and establishment of Lutheranism in Germany and beyond.",

This division was between those who supported the Roman Catholic position and those who aligned with the Reformation. The significance of the protest lies in the Reformation princes' opposition to a resolution backed by the Catholic princes and the emperor, which aimed to prevent the spread of Luther's teachings in new areas. The Reformation princes argued that \"Matters concerning salvation were of an individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to oppose the resolution.\" This stance reflects the national mind concerning matters of salvation by emphasizing the individual's right to determine their own beliefs and practices regarding salvation, free from external legislative control. It underscores a shift in thinking from a collective, institutionally controlled belief system to one that prioritizes personal conscience and individual faith. This protest and the principles it defended indicate how the ideas Luther had declared only eight years prior were becoming integrated into the broader national consciousness, moving towards a more personal and individual understanding of faith and salvation.",

The text mentions that \"Sparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations.\" This widespread adoption and adaptation of Reformation principles across different regions and among various groups necessitated a response from the governing and religious authorities of the time, particularly the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Charles.\n\nThe major purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to \"harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with Rome.\" In essence, the diet aimed to address the religious fragmentation and conflicts that had arisen due to the spread of Reformation ideas. It sought to bring together representatives of the different Protestant factions to define their teachings in a unified manner, in hopes of either reconciling these divergent views with the Roman Catholic Church or at least mitigating the religious and political tensions that the Reformation had exacerbated. The text indicates that each Protestant body was to \"define its teaching in a statement or confession,\" although not all groups were represented, and only three confessions were actually submitted. This effort underscores the significant impact of the Reformation's spread on the political and religious landscape of Europe, prompting attempts at dialogue and reconciliation through the convening of such a significant assembly.",

Additionally, the emperor forbade \"witnessing and the printing or sale of Lutheran writings,\" which was a significant blow to the spread and practice of Lutheran beliefs, as it restricted their ability to disseminate their teachings and conduct their religious practices openly.\n\nIn response to these actions and the broader rejection of their efforts to reform the church, the Lutherans experienced a sense of dejection. They went home in the fall of 1530 \"dejected by their failure to reform the church,\" which indicates a period of discouragement and perhaps introspection about their movement's future. However, this setback did not mark the end of their efforts. Unbeknownst to them at the time, their confession \"would become a basic creed of the largest Protestant body in the world,\" suggesting that despite the immediate setbacks, their foundational beliefs and doctrines would eventually gain significant traction and influence.\n\nMoreover, in the face of continued threats and coercion from the Romanists in Germany, the Lutherans took a more unified and strategic approach by forming the League of Schmalkalden in 1531 with other Protestants. This alliance was a direct response to the pressures they faced, indicating a shift towards a more collective and organized resistance against the Roman Catholic efforts to suppress the Reformation. This league represented a significant step in consolidating Protestant forces, which helped to delay armed conflict over religious principles until the summer of 1546, showcasing a strategic pivot in how the Lutherans and their allies sought to protect and advance their cause in a hostile political and religious landscape.",

His journey began with a deep concern about his relationship with God, which was not selfish but stemmed from a need to understand and share the truth he discovered. This concern led him to search through \"lonely tormented hours in a monastery\" until he found what he considered the truth in the Bible. From the Bible, Luther learned that \"God is love instead of wrath\" and that salvation is \"God's free gift,\" not something that can be earned or mediated by any human authority like a pope or king. This foundational belief directly influenced his teachings and actions, emphasizing the direct relationship between an individual and God without the need for ecclesiastical intermediaries.\n\nLuther's concern for others and his desire to share the treasure he found in the Bible motivated him to preach, despite opposition, and to translate the Bible into the vernacular. He believed that \"the school must be the next thing to the church,\" highlighting the importance of education in understanding faith. His translation of the Bible from \"Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament\" into the language of \"Hans and Hilda\" made the scriptures accessible to the common people, democratizing religious knowledge and empowering individuals to engage directly with their faith.\n\nMoreover, Luther's humility and dedication to reforming the church according to the Scriptures are evident in his statement to the nobles at Worms: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\" This statement underscores how his personal journey and discoveries shaped his lifelong mission to reform the church based on biblical principles, rather than seeking power or personal gain.\n\nIn summary, Luther's personal journey of faith profoundly influenced his teachings and actions by driving him to discover and share the truth of God's love and grace found in the Bible, to make religious knowledge accessible to all, and to reform the church to align with the teachings of the Scriptures.",

The text states, \"So that each might know the truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred Scriptures... not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda.\" This accessibility allowed individuals to engage directly with the Scriptures, fostering personal interpretation and understanding of religious texts, which was a significant departure from the prevailing practice of relying solely on the clergy for interpretation.\n\nSecondly, Luther's translation empowered the common people by promoting literacy and education. The text highlights Luther's belief in the importance of education, stating, \"âThe devil prefers blockheads,â he said, therefore, âthe school must be the next thing to the church.â\" By making the Bible available in the vernacular, Luther encouraged the common people to learn to read and study the Bible for themselves. This push for literacy and personal study of the Scriptures was instrumental in spreading Luther's teachings, as it enabled a broader segment of the population to access and disseminate his ideas.\n\nLastly, Luther's approach to translating the Bible was aimed at ensuring that \"the lords and ladies would understand it that way too,\" indicating his intention to make the Scriptures understandable to everyone, regardless of their social status. This democratization of religious knowledge challenged the existing power structures within the church and society, as it shifted the control and interpretation of religious texts from the clergy to the individual believer.\n\nIn summary, Luther's translation of the Bible into the vernacular was pivotal in spreading his teachings and empowering the common people by making the Scriptures accessible and understandable to all, promoting literacy and education, and democratizing religious knowledge.",

This principle underscores the centrality of Scripture in understanding God's nature and His relationship with humanity.\n\n2. **God's Love as a Free Gift**: Luther learned from the Bible that \"no one, pope or king, can stand between man and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for himself. It is God's free gift.\" This emphasizes the principle that salvation and God's love cannot be earned through human efforts or intermediaries but are freely given by God.\n\n3. **Individual's Direct Relationship with God**: By asserting that no earthly authority can mediate God's love, Luther highlighted the principle of a direct and personal relationship between the individual and God. This was a radical departure from the prevailing view that the church and its hierarchy were necessary intermediaries between God and man.\n\nRegarding his role in the church's reformation, Luther's humility is evident in his statement to the nobles at Worms: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\" This reflects his self-perception not as seeking power or fame, but as a humble servant tasked with bringing the church back in line with the teachings of the Bible.

Now there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was essential and arrangements had to be made for their training and support. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of endeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had lapsed into indifference.\nLuther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted him. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use he felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there had to be some sort of oversight.\nThe bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were loath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony beginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of Germany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization began.",

From 1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts which had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the Reformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to oppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared only eight years before were becoming the national mind.\nSparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with Rome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or confession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were actually submitted.\nAs usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced the emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best ammunition for the Saxon \"heretics,\" fully confident that a Lutheran defeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.\nStill under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at a castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others appearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight articles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The first twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures regarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church, the Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin, Good Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of Roman abuses which contradict the Word of God.\nThe emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation. On the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church property restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the printing or sale of Lutheran writings.\nDejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home in the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic creed of the largest Protestant body in the world.\nThreatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with other Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was averted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish invasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was delayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months earlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead of fear.\nThe circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace, where he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died early on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing himself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.",

Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a monastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he found the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's revelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is love instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for himself. It is God's free gift.\nThen his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to keep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of evil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to stop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so soft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the ramparts of his mighty-fortress God.\n\"The devil prefers blockheads,\" he said, therefore, \"the school must be the next thing to the church.\" Concern led him to teach. Professor was the only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who arrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred Scriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were translated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would understand it that way too.\nThe principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the promise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount the humility of his service: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\"",

Firstly, Luther believed in the importance of individuals being able to access and understand the Scriptures directly. He translated the Bible into the vernacular language so that \"each might know the truth himself, and in that truth be free.\" This was a departure from the traditional practice of keeping the Bible in Latin and limiting its interpretation to clergy and scholars.\n\nSecondly, Luther emphasized the importance of education and teaching. He believed that \"the school must be the next thing to the church\" and took on the role of a professor to ensure that people had access to proper instruction. This focus on education for all was a shift from the elitist approach to knowledge that was prevalent at the time.\n\nLastly, Luther's teaching philosophy was centered on reforming the church based on the Scriptures. He stated, \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness to the Word of God alone.\" This emphasis on the primacy of the Word of God over human traditions and interpretations challenged the traditional authority of the church and its hierarchy.\n\nIn summary, Luther's teaching philosophy differed from the traditional approach of his time by advocating for direct access to the Scriptures, promoting education for all, and prioritizing reform based on the Word of God.",

Koppenhaver's book \"Martin Luther\" meticulously outlines the significant milestones and events in the life of Martin Luther, a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. The timeline commences with Luther's birth on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, and traces his journey through education, religious commitment, and his pivotal role in challenging the Catholic Church, culminating in his death on February 18, 1546.\n\nLuther's early life saw a move from Eisleben to Mansfeld in 1484, followed by his education in Magdeburg and Eisenach. In 1501, he entered the University of Erfurt, where he earned a master of arts degree in 1505. His sudden vow to become a monk in July of the same year marked the beginning of his religious career, leading to his entry into the Augustinian cloister in Erfurt and his ordination to the priesthood in 1507.\n\nLuther's academic and theological pursuits continued as he taught in Wittenberg and lectured at the University of Erfurt. His journey to Rome in 1510 and subsequent return to Wittenberg as a professor in 1511 were pivotal in shaping his theological insights. In 1512, he received a doctor of sacred scripture degree, solidifying his academic credentials.\n\nThe year 1517 was a watershed moment in Luther's life and in the history of Christianity when he posted his ninety-five theses, challenging the Catholic Church's practices. This act sparked a series of events, including a summons to Rome in 1518 and a public debate with Eck in Leipzig in 1519. Luther's defiance of the Papal bull in 1520, culminating in his excommunication and the burning of the bull, marked his irrevocable break with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Diet of Worms in 1521, where Luther famously refused to recant his teachings, led to his banishment and subsequent stay at the Wartburg. His return to Wittenberg in 1522 was followed by significant personal and professional developments, including his marriage to Katherine von Bora in 1525 and the composition of \"A Mighty Fortress\" in 1527.\n\nLuther's later years saw continued theological contributions, most notably the publication of the complete Bible in German in 1534, making the scriptures accessible to a broader audience. His involvement in the Augsburg Confession in 1530 underscored his enduring influence on Protestant theology.\n\nThe chronology concludes with Luther's death in 1546, marking the end of an era but also the enduring legacy of his reformative work. This detailed timeline not only highlights Luther's personal milestones and spiritual journey but also encapsulates his profound impact on the religious, cultural, and political landscape of his time.",

The text does not specify the content of this statement, but given the historical context, it likely pertained to his teachings and writings that were under scrutiny.\n\n- **Refusal to Recant:** The most significant part of Luther's experience at the Diet of Worms came on April 18, 1521, when he refused to recant his positions. This refusal was a defining moment, solidifying his stance against certain practices of the Catholic Church and contributing to the Protestant Reformation.\n\n- **Aftermath:** After his refusal to recant, Luther left Worms on April 26, 1521. Shortly thereafter, on May 4, 1521, he arrived at the Wartburg. This period marked the beginning of his enforced seclusion, during which he continued his work, including translating the New Testament into German. The Diet's immediate aftermath also included Luther being banned by the Edict of Worms on May 26, 1521, which declared him an outlaw and forbade anyone from helping him.\n\nThis sequence of events at the Diet of Worms highlights Luther's steadfastness in his beliefs, his confrontation with ecclesiastical authority, and the significant consequences that followed his refusal to recant.",

By posting these theses, Luther invited scholarly debate on important theological issues, setting the stage for religious reform.\n\n2. **Papal Response (1520):** The timeline indicates that by June 15, 1520, a Papal bull was signed, presumably in response to Luther's growing criticism of the Church. By October 10, 1520, Luther received the bull, and by December 10, 1520, he had publicly burned it. This act of defiance against the Papal authority was significant, as it demonstrated Luther's rejection of the Catholic Church's attempts to silence his calls for reform. It symbolically represented a break with the Church, rallying others who shared his concerns.\n\n3. **Diet of Worms (1521):** The series of events at the Diet of Worms from January 27 to May 26, 1521, marked a crucial point in Luther's life and the broader Reformation. Luther's arrival at Worms on April 16, his first statement on April 17, and his refusal to recant his writings on April 18, showed his unwavering commitment to his beliefs in the face of potential severe consequences. His departure from Worms on April 26 and subsequent ban by the Edict of Worms on May 26 further solidified his position as a reformer in opposition to the Catholic Church.\n\nThese actions collectively had a profound impact on the Protestant Reformation. Luther's posting of the ninety-five theses sparked a movement that questioned the practices and authority of the Catholic Church. His subsequent defiance against the Papal bull and his steadfastness at the Diet of Worms inspired others to question and seek reform in the Church. These events not only contributed to the spread of Protestantism but also encouraged the development of new Christian denominations and influenced religious thought and freedom in Europe.",

This event is significant in Luther's personal life as it marks a major personal milestone, transitioning from a life dedicated solely to religious and academic pursuits to also embracing the role of a husband. The text does not provide details on the nature of their marriage or its direct impact on Luther's personal life beyond the fact of the marriage itself.\n\nRegarding the broader religious landscape of the time, the text does not explicitly connect Luther's marriage to Katherine von Bora with any specific religious or reformative developments. However, given the context of Luther's life and the period of the Reformation, his marriage could be seen as significant for several reasons not directly mentioned in the text:\n\n1. **Clerical Celibacy**: Luther's marriage would have been a direct challenge to the Roman Catholic Church's requirement of clerical celibacy. By marrying, Luther not only defied the Church's rules but also set a precedent for other clergy who wished to marry.\n\n2. **Personal Example**: As a leading figure of the Reformation, Luther's actions had a profound impact on his followers. His marriage could be interpreted as an embodiment of his teachings, advocating for the reform of the Church's practices and the personal freedom of clergy.\n\n3. **Social and Religious Reform**: Luther's marriage might have contributed to the broader social and religious reform movements of the time by questioning and challenging established Church doctrines and practices.\n\nWhile the text does not delve into these implications, the mention of Luther's marriage to Katherine von Bora on June 13, 1525, serves as a factual statement about an event in his life. The broader significance of this marriage in the context of religious reform and Luther's personal life would need to be inferred from the historical context and Luther's role in the Reformation, which the text does not explicitly address.",
